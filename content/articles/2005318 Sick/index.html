Ya, I'm sick today. Started about last night, and it's looking to be a relatively serious case of the flu. Please pray for me, I don't want to be sick on my birthday <img class="emote" src="http://www.xanga.com/images/silly.gif" />

In other news - Chels gets to chat for one hour sometime this week <img class="emote" src="http://www.xanga.com/images/laughing.gif" />  for her birthday, her parents are letting her... awesome <img class="emote" src="http://www.xanga.com/images/laughing.gif" />  Time yet to be set, but I'll be on no matter when it is or if I'm even still sick then <img class="emote" src="http://www.xanga.com/images/silly.gif" />

Not much else going on just now... at least not that I can think of...
