It's so true!  Many times when using Facebook I find that there's no way to properly describe my relationship to a person with their options!  <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/06/01/request-to-facebook-broaden-the-how-i-know-you-options/">TechCrunch</a> (and <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/05/29/easyUpgradeToFacebook.html">Dave Winer</a>) has some great ideas on what they could do to add some more.  I hope they do it!
