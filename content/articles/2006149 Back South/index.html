<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Voi√†, for those of you who knew it not I spent the last week in our nation's brilliant capital of N'djamena. Went up to help Dad with some work and watch him and whatnot. Usually NDJ is dreadful, but this time it wasn't too bad. We managed to get their computer issues worked out and Dad did a lot of other stuff for them up there. I was sick one day, which was rather nasty, but I'm better now and almost glad that I got sick because of the good that came from it :) They have 5-channel satellite TV up there now, which was kinda neat. After the first night of channel surfing though I had one thing on my mind -- PVR! This whole bit where you turn on the TV and a show is partly over and you can't rewind to find out what happened before just annoys me. They had this idiotic tabloid show running about who married who and got divorced in the same day and all that retarded stuff. Lots of sitcoms, which was awesome :D And BBC aired a live press conference where President Bush said he would start yet another war in the Middle East, this time against the Palestinians... well actually he said he would try not to but it was a rather thinly veiled threat ;) So I'm back now and catching up on my emails took most of the morning what with this code busted and this person wanting my code for that and this new code to look at etcetc, hehe. I wish I had more time sometimes! ;)

And now for a funny story that comes straight from last night's sermon:

A little girl came to her grandmother one day and asked, "Grandma, how old are you?"
"Well," said Grandma, "you see dear, when you're as old as I am you don't tell people your age."
"Don't wory, Grandma," said the little girl assuringly, "You can trust me."
"I'm sorry, dear, but I'm not going to tell you my age."
The little girl realised she wasn't getting anywhere and walked off. After twenty minutes she hadn't showed up again and Grandma was getting curious. She checked around and found her granddaughter upstairs digging through her purse.
"What are you doing?" Grandma asked.
"Grandma," replied the little girl, "You're 76!"
"Why, that's right!" said Grandma, "How did you know?"
"Well," the little girl smiled, "I found your driver's license and it says the year you were born. So I subtracted that from this year and figured you're 76!"
Her grandmother was surprised, but the little girl wasn't finished yet.
"Guess what else I found Grandma?"
"What, dear?"
"Your driver's license also says that you got an F in sex!"

LOL! :D
