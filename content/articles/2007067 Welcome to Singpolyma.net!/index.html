Some of you may have noticed the gradual changes going on -- most notably the 150 or so of you who read me by feed.  I am moving my primary web presences from Blogger to a self-hosted WordPress on singpolyma.net.

My Technical, Personal, and XOXO blogs are all here (see tabs above) with all their content.  If the old ones aren't properly redirecting yet, they will be soon -- going to a post on the old sites should take you to that post on this site.  Feeds have not changed much, they are still on FeedBurner, but there is now a main feed (and blog) that combines posts from all three!

The site is not 100% done, obviously (a hacker's site never is ;) ), so if you see something that needs to be added/changed, feel free to contact me!

For this launch I have upgraded my <a href="/plugins/freshtags/">FreshTags</a> plugin and written <a href="/plugins/videntity/">Videntity</a> and <a href="/plugins/oldblog/">OldBlog redirection</a> plugins.  All my <a href="/plugins/">WordPress plugins</a> now have thier own page.

Some of my TechBlog readers may fear (and, in fact, this has been voiced to me) that now that I am WordPress-powered I will forget Blogger.  Not true at all.  My existing hacks will receive maintenance, and new ones will be coming.  I am not deleting my account or anything ;).

So, to finish this post up, I would like to <a href="/credits/">thank those who made this site possible</a>.  If I forgot anyone or anything, it shall be added.
