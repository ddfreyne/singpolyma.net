<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">So it's time for an update. I haven't updated in awhile for two reasons (1) not much has happened (2) I keep forgetting :P The latter being the more truthful of the two. Every time I think in the afternoon or evening 'I should write a post tomorrow', I completely forget during the day :P Not that anyone cares prolly -- the only two ppl who really read this a lot are prolly Trev and Chels, and I talk to Chels everyday and Trev most days. Anyway... so... what's been happening with me?

Well I've been catching up with Chels :) Four (or five? more?) months of separation do things to you -- and one of those things is that you tend to lose touch some ;) I've been having great fun just hanging with her, playing randomquestionstilwedrop, and torturing Markus (so sorry, I'm gonna try to tone it down, honest!). I've also been doing school (duh) and the good news is that my grades are coming up some -- although they really need to come up a lot more for me to be halfway happy with them :P I've been working on my many projects, although muchos less than before. I also just finished reading <i>the world's stoopeedest book</i>. I'm not kidding. Uncle Kerwin told me to read it because it was atrociously lousy, partly to get a second opinion, mostly for kicks. It's called <i>Seawitch</i>, don't remember the author now, but it is so terribly disjointed and dry and confusing with poor wordings and completely unrealistic sequences that the author really deserves to be taken out and shot!! I'm not a hard-core good-literature-only sort of guy, but some things are just too dumb to be worth considering... at least now I know that some of the 'worse' books are not as bad as they at first did seem (ie HG Wells stuff) ;)

Was that enough? Want me to keep going? Did you even make it this far? I hope to be posting some stuff to my Flickr soon... I have such a photo backlog by now that it's getting pretty rediculous and will take awhile to catch up... I also need to remember to scan in my EBC application today (I know, terrible, Trev's accepted and I'm not applied :P)... but I guess this is it for now, so until next time.

Remember, God made you special, and He loves you very much ;)
!!BYE!!
