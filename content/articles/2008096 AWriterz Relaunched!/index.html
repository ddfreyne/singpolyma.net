I have re-written and re-launched <a href="http://awriterz.org">AWriterz</a> - my service for hosting creative works.  Basically, I took my Web 1.0 service and brought it to the new web.  Logins are now powered by OpenID and it tries to get some data automatically through SREG, SGAPI, and hCard.  There is a karma-like system to prevent spam (and eventually reward active users), and users can tag and rate every work (and upload there own).  I'm trying to emphasize CreativeCommons on the site, but I'm not enforcing it.

I'm really hoping to build more DiSo-like functionality in as the site progresses and I get more user feedback :)
