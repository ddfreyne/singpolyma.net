I have completed the a Blogger comments syndication service, which grew from <a href="http://some-assembly-required.blogspot.com/2005/12/comments-feed-for-blogger.html">a hack</a> I proposed on <a href="http://some-assembly-required.blogspot.com/">Some Assembly Required</a>.  Dubbed <a href="http://bloggercomments.ning.com/">Blogger Recent Comments</a>, this service takes the URL to a compatible Blogger blog and generates an RSS, JSON, JavaScript, or XHTML feed of the recent comments to that blog.  It can also generate feeds for recent comments to individual post pages.  For blogs that are set up per <a href="http://bloggercomments.ning.com/instructions.php">the instructions</a>, comments are archived by the service as they come in, the service being notified of new comments via email, thus enabling the service to include new comments to old posts in the feed (unlike the <a href="http://bloggerhacks.blogspot.com/2004/09/farrago-recent-comments-hack-103.html">Farrago Recent Comments Hack</a>, which only shows new comments to posts on the main page).  Setting up your blog to be compatible (per <a href="http://bloggercomments.ning.com/instructions.php">these instructions</a>) is relatively painless, and afterwards you should never have to worry about it again, but you gain the benefits of comments feeds and optional sidebar elements.
