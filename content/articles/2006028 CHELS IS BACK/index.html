*extremely happy*  *bursting at the seams*  *shaking and quaking with delight*  That's right!  Chels is ungrounded!!!  If you don't know how extatic that makes me, you don't know a thing about me ;)   I haven't actually talked to her again yet... she's not online this very moment (shame on her ;P, hehe) but I will :D  I got some emails, that she was <span style="font-style: italic;">actually allowed to send!</span>  :D:D   it feels so good... I'd scream, but I don't want my family thinking I'm obsessed or anything *cough*  ;)   YAY :D
