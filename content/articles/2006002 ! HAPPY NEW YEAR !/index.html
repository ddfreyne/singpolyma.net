How was your'n?  Stayed up allll the night did we.  The whole station (which now consists of Bromans, us, and Aunt Metchtild -- hoyts coming in for a week starting today, crosses too) and the Ezels got together in the dorm for an all nighter.  We had pizza and pizza and LOTS of pizza (don't ask me how many pieces I ate, I lost count), then snacked for the rest of the night (food keeps you awake).  We played UNO Attack for quite awhile (hours and many rounds).  It's just like UNO -- only with different special cards and a card-launcher instead of a draw pile (the card launcher sometimes launches 5 instead of the normal drawing one -- ouch!).  Then we watch <span style="font-style: italic;">The Incredibles</span>, which, incidentally, is an awesome movie :D  I had watched it (it's mine, got for Christmas) with my family last week, but the Bromans and Ezels hadn't seen it.  Emme Ezel is soooooo cute :D  I love babies, hehe, luvluvluv :D  hmmm.... not much else going on around here -- although there might be when the Hoyts get here this afternoon, one never does know.

There was actually something else I was going to say... but I forget what it was... besides that Dan had to go to NDJ with dad today for dental work (cavity he) and won't be back for a week... I <span style="font-style: italic;">know</span> there was something else.... ah, well... until next time :)
