<b title="Updated 2007-02-19">I have a <a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/2006/12/for-new-blogger-blogger-delicious.html">version of this script for the new Blogger</a> as well.</b>

Many people have installed <a href="http://ecmanaut.blogspot.com/2005/11/blogger-publish-ping-and-categorizer.html">Johan Sundstr√∂m's del.icio.us Categoriser Script</a> and reaped the benefits.  Some have also used my <a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/2006/05/trackback-inside-blogger.html">trackback script</a> to enable outbound trackback inside Blogger.  Now the power of these two scripts comes together to benefit everyone!

With Johan's full approval I have married the two scripts into one <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/4712">categoriser and trackback</a> script.  This script is set up in such a way that installing it should overwrite any previous installation of Johan's script and keep your existing script settings.  To find out more about the categorising and pinging functions of the script, please read <a href="http://ecmanaut.blogspot.com/2005/11/blogger-publish-ping-and-categorizer.html">Johan's post</a>.

The trackback features work slightly differently than they did in my previous script.  On the post-create page there is now a 'Trackback' textarea, instead of a form on the 'post complete' page.  Enter one or more trackback URLs (each on it's own line in the textarea) to use the trackack feature.  After publishing the post your trackbacks will be sent out automatically and the status will be displayed on the 'post complete' page.  For more information on trackback, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackback">go to Wikipedia</a>.

There are also a couple minor new features for the categorising in this release.  One is the option to use the first 200 characters of the post body in the extended field on del.icio.us, instead of the datestamp.  The 'Tags:' label that one clicks to change settings is now blue, and your cursor should change into a hand when hovering it.  Also, when republishing your whole blog the link to del.icio.us from your last post will not be displayed.
