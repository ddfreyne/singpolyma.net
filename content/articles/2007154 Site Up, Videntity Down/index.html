Hello loyal and less loyal readers!

Recently, my blog (and entire site, really) has been... down.  Or at least dead slow.  It was a problem with my cache plugin (wp-cache) which I have since resolved with the help of <a href="http://trevorcreech.com/">a friend</a>.

You might be annoyed by my main page looking like it's messed up.  It draws its data from <a href="http://videntity.org/">videntity.org</a>, which is currently down.  It probably should cache the data in the future to prevent this happening again.

If you want to see updates from me and this main site is down, check me out on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/p/Stephen_Paul_Weber/515373050">Facebook</a> or <a href="http://www.xanga.com/swearinghater">Xanga</a>.
