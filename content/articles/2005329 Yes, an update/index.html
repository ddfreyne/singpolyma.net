So I haven't said anything in a long while.  I've meant to a couple times, but I keep forgetting.  Lately I've been kinda bored... to show you just <span style="font-style: italic;">how</span> bored I'll tell you what Daniel and I did the other night - signed things to each other in sign language.  Doesn't sound <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span> bad until you realise what we were signing... he knows almost no signs yet and I learned all I know from him, so we were sitting in the living room signing things like 'You are an orange' and 'I am not you' and then cracking ourselves up about it.  Ya, really bored and really tired.

The <a href="http://www.teamchad.org/Palmview/">Palmview</a> Christmas program is coming soon... either tomorrow or next Saturday.  Way early I know, but it's how things fit into the school year.  I am playing one song on my baritone with the 'band' (which is really a trio).

Tomorrow (I think it's tomorrow) I am being hauled off to a sleepover with a guy half my age (ok, ok, a little more) that I hardly know.  My brother is going so if I don't I look rude *sigh*... hopefully I won't die of utter and <span style="font-style: italic;">complete</span> boredom.

Yes, school is alright... it'd be better with <a href="http://www.xanga.com/razamoda">Chels</a> back... so I wait...

Not much else... well, there might be, but I've forgotten it, so byeallfornow!  If you read this, comment so I know how many readers I get, lol
