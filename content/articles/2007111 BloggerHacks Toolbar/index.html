Yet another experiment in following the community.  I have used the toolbar-creation tools from <a href="http://conduit.com/">Conduit</a> to create a social toolbar for the Blogger hacks community.

The toolbar has links to all the major Blogger hackers (if I forgot you, I'm sorry, tell me and I'll add your link!), a drop-down to the main sections of the hacks wiki, a built-in search of the wiki (the co-op one isn't allowed... but I linked to it), a feed-reader that alerts your when a hacker posts something new, and an announce section for community-wide alerts.  There is also a chatroom, email notification, weather, and pop-up blocking option.  All components are optional.

One of the really cool things is that there is a version for both <a href="http://getfirefox.com/" title="For if you have Internet Explorer ;)">Firefox</a> <em>and</em> Internet Explorer.  If I update the toolbar components on their site, <em>everyone's</em> toolbar gets updated, without a reinstall.

So, check it out at the <a href="http://bloggerhacks.communitytoolbars.com/">toolbar homepage</a>.
