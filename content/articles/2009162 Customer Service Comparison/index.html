Say what you like about Dreamhost, their customer service rocks.

I've been using Boxbe for some time as an email whitelist service to quarantine all email not from my contacts (if sent to one of my catch-all email addresses).  This works great to stop SPAM while still letting me review easily for any potential ham.  There are two problems with this approach: (1) it's slow (2) it requires proxying all my mail through 4 different mailboxes.

So I was looking for some solutions.  The Dreamhost support people (after I finally explained to them what whitelisting is) told me how to do it with their server-side filters.  Unfortunately, since they've disabled procmail support, this requires creating hundred of filters by hand through a weird web GUI.  Not awesome, and certainly not feasible.

So I was also in touch with the Boxbe people to see if things could be improved from their end.  I asked three things.

I asked if they could please allow importing GMail address books without the use of a GMail password, so that I could keep them in sync without exporting my contacts to a file all the time.

The response: "Currently, there are no plans in the works for this."

I asked if they could add a view to see approved email similar to how they have a view for waitlisted emails.

The response: they pointed me at their waitlist view, as though that solved the problem.

I asked if they could ping Dreamhost to get the ban on forwarding catch-all email addresses to Boxbe lifted.

The response: "At this time, Boxbe is a stand-alone application service, but we will pass this along to our Product Development team."

All in all, an awful customer service experience.  I then found out they have a GetSatisfaction forum.  I checked it out, and found that any real problems posted there are replied to with robot-like requests for the user to email support.  I really don't think they get it.
