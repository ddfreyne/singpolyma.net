From the ultra-creative minds of Stephen Paul Weber (that's me!) and <a href="http://trevorcreech.com/">Trevor Creech</a> comes a service you may never have expected.

<a href="http://pranketh.com/">Pranketh</a> is designed with but one purpose in mind -- to send prank emails.  Fill in the form with who you want the email to go to... <em>and</em> who you want it to come <em>from</em>!  Pranketh will send you message and when the recipient opens it, it will appear to be from whomever you specified!  Then, when they reply, it will go to that person and watch the confusion!

Have fun, but don't hurt anyone ;)
