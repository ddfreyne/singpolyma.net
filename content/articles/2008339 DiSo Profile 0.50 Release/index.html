Hot on the heels of the <a href="/2008/12/actionstream-050-released/">Actionstream 0.50 release</a> comes the 0.50 release of <a href="/plugins/diso-profile/">DiSo Profile</a>! It can be downloaded from the <a href="/wp-diso-profile.tar.bz2">usual place</a>.

<strong>Note:</strong> The permissions logic has been spun out into the new <a href="http://diso.googlecode.com/svn/wordpress/permissions/">permissions plugin</a>.Â  <strong>Make sure</strong> your install and activate that plugin first if you have any private data, or it will be displayed to the public.
