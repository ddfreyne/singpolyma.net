Posts and comments on your blog display in your timezone (usually).  This sucks for your readers.  What makes sense to them is <em>their</em> timezone.  <span class="vcard"><a class="fn url" href="http://trevorcreech.com/" rel="friend met">Trevor Creech</a></span> and I have written a WordPress plugin to fix this.  Using a <a href="http://ecmanaut.blogspot.com/2006/01/ajax-date-time-time-zones-best.html">technique suggested by Johan Sundstr√∂m</a> and the <a href="http://www.svendtofte.com/code/date_format/">formatDate JavaScript library by Svend Tofte</a>, this plugin shows post and comment timestamps in the viewer's local timezone.
