Richard Conn Henry has a potentially revolutionary new idea, with a few bugs...

Richard Conn Henry (he credits others on the  site, but I will just mention his name here) has created a new calendar  system so that every date is the same weekday, every year.  The  idea is similar to the one familiar to any huge LotR buffs as the  calendar of the hobbits.  The difference is that instead of having  days that are not part of the year, you end up with a whole extra week  in its own 'mini-month' ever 5 or 6 years.  The whole thing is  worked out, except for a few quibbles I have with it, listed below as  taken from an email I sent him.  I may have thought of other  stuff, but this is my main analysis:

- You mention the  problem of people born on Jauray 31, etc.  You solution (just  celebrate on the new last day of the month) is very good, but there is  the other option of celebrating when your birthday WOULD be, according  to the Gregorian calendar date (i.e., the first of the next month)

- Most of the point of C&amp;T is convenience, however you suggest the  elimination of time zones... how is this convenient?  I, for one,  think waking up at midnight being normal is just plain  inconvenient.  Everyone already uses UTC for international  dealings, why change how it is done locally?

- I really like the idea of going to 24hr time everywhere.

- The idea that everyone born on a Newton week should celebrate their  birthday on the 4th of July is, in my opinion, a bigoted American  idea.  It would be the same situation as someone born on leap-day  according to the current calendar.  They would probably just move  to the closest day.

- I like the idea of removing daylight  savings time, however changing working hours in its place may be a  problem.  Most employers would simply refuse to do it.

-  Although yyyy-mm-dd is ISO standard, I don't see the problem with using  the worldwide (excluding north america) standard of dd-mm-yyyy, it is  just the same thing backward.

- Moving Christmas to a Sunday  is not such a hot idea, for two reasons.  One, it ceases to be a  real holiday and is just a special weekend.  Two, we Christians  (who pretty much invented the original holdiay) will no longer be able  to have a special Christmas service to celebrate the birth of Our  Lord.  We will be required to 'specialise' the normal Sunday  service, thus degrading the holdiday.

- Are you aware that JRR Tolkein created a calandar based on a similar idea for use by the hobbits in LotR?
