Ok, first thing's first, PTL MY BOOKS ARRIVED!  Now I can start school, ALL my courses, so I'll be playing catch-up for awhile.

Now on to my latest beef : After getting Breakaway for more than a year I am generally dissatisfied with the magazine's content.  It is 50% sports and celebrity interviews… here's a breakdown of the last issue's content:

2pgs – mail
2pgs – spiritual (article about setting yourself on fire for God)
3pgs – nonfiction (article about the holocaust)
1pgs – celebrity (tobymac)
7pgs – sports (2pgs baseball, 5pgs NASCAR)
2pgs – comedy (funny story about outcast highschooler)
3pgs – Q&amp;A
2pgs – workout
2pgs – Other (article about safety on the Internet)

That’s 24 pages total. Not being a big fan of sports in general, and pro sports in particular, one can easily see why the sports/workout articles are of no interest to me.  Lose 7 + 2 pages, leaving 15.  I don’t particularly care for celebrity interviews either, who cares what tobymac thinks?  That leaves 14 pages of semi-interesting content.  The article about safety on the Internet was mildly interesting, if that.  That leave 12 pages of truly interesting content.  12/24… 50%.  Not too impressive :P  Now this is my personal likes and dislikes, but my brother (who is athletic) has about the same impression of the magazine…  the general feeling I get from girls is that they love Brio, so I checked it out and I must admit the content quality is much higher (if girl-oriented ;P)

So here's the question – does anyone know of another (better) Christian Teen magazine?  (not necessarily boy-oriented, it can be generic)… and if such a one were to be found how many others would be interested in it?
