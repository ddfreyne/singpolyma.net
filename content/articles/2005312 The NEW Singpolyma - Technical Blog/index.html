I have moved my technical blog from it's <a href="http://singpolyma.blog.com/">old home on blog.com</a> to <a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/">this new blogger site</a> for multiple reasons. One is that I was growing sick of the uncustomisability of the blog.com templates. Another is that blog.com recently has been undergoing maintenance and upgrading for the <span style="font-style: italic;">third</span>  time since I started with them, and while blogger may not be perfect, it is definately <span style="font-style: italic;">less</span> buggy right now.  Here are the URLs for all things as per this new site :

Site URL - <a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/">http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/</a>
Post Feed - <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/singpolyma-techblog/">http://feeds.feedburner.com/singpolyma-techblog/</a>
Comments Feed - <a href="http://app.feeddigest.com/digest3/FTDZN6YNPD.rss">http://app.feeddigest.com/digest3/FTDZN6YNPD.rss</a>
All Tags - <a href="http://del.icio.us/singpolyma.techblog/">http://del.icio.us/singpolyma.techblog/</a>

I will slowly be moving all posts from the old site over to this one and backdating them so that the archives work properly, and will be updating the del.icio.us account simultaneously. Some of the posts have already moved, but I am working from oldest to newest so it may be awhile before they're all there. Yes, I am moving the comments too, which may cause the comments feed to act funny for awhile.

Feedback on this new site design is welcome as I work out the bugs in the move.
