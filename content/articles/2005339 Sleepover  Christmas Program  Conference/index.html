So what happened to me and the Sleepover / Christmas program et al?  Well the sleepover went alright, and it actually was a lot of fun.  We played a lot of crazy games, like one where we put some M&amp;M's on a paper towel stretched over a bowl full of water.  Then you poke holes in the paper towel with a pencil.  The person to send the M&amp;M's into the water has to eat them out of the water without using their hands!  That gets disgusting <img src="http://www.xanga.com/images/winky.gif" alt=";)" />  We stayed up really late watching Hook and generally had a good time.

Next day was the Christmas Program, which went well.  I played my one song with the band and then watched the rest from the audience.  Everything went off perfectly without problem and we quickly came to the best part : <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);font-size:180%;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Refreshments!</span></span>

The Symons left a few days ago, they're in N'Djamena now and soon on their way out.

On Friday the whole <a href="http://www.teamchad.org/">TEAM Chad</a> field goes to Annual Conference, including me.  We'll be gone just over a week with probably no Internet or Email of any kind the entire time.
