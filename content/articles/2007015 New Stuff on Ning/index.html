This post is to announce two previously unannounced projects of mine over on <a href="http://www.ning.com/">Ning</a>.  I've been working on both for some time, and both could do with some more work certainly.  Both are ready to be test-driven though (at least in the fundamentals).

The smaller project is <a href="http://someblogs.ning.com/">Some Blogs</a>.  Some Blogs is a reporting engine for personal blogs, sexblogs, and other less-than-public-material blogs.  Inspired by <a href="http://splogspot.com/">splogspot</a>, this index is NOT for splogs (that's what splogspot is for).  It is for material that most people don't want to see (when I search for XOXO I want microformats articles, not 'I luv u Jodi!' :P).

The other, larger, project which benefits from the first is <a href="http://littluns.ning.com/">Littl'uns</a>.  The original concept was to be like <a href="http://techmeme.com/">TechMeme</a> for smaller blogs, however the concept has evolved over time and the meme-engine is currently only an experimental 'related posts' link.

Nestled in the code for Littl'uns is <a href="http://littluns.ning.com/bsrch/">BSrch</a>, a meta blogsearch engine.

Anyway, enjoy!  Report bugs!  Give feedback! :D
