All the email addresses we keep with our <a href="http://www.golden.net/">ISP</a> in Canada died yesterday. There was a billing issue and all our services got turned off until we called in to resolve it. My dad has had the same address with that company since the invention of email, and everyone knows it. So he got on the phone, long distance to Canada to straighten it out. It seems they wanted to bill us for an actual internet package instead of just the email addresses and webspace. Anyway, he got it sorted out and the addresses are all re-activated, but our <a href="http://home.golden.net/%7Epsweber/">webspace</a> is still dead.  Hope to get that sorted out soon.
