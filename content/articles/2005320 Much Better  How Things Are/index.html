I am feeling much better now <img class="emote" src="http://www.xanga.com/images/happy.gif" /> I was mostly better yesterday, well enough to enjoy my birthday, so I'm thankful for that. I didn't have the stomache for snacking at the party, but it could have been much worse <img class="emote" src="http://www.xanga.com/images/happy.gif" /> I had a great day, first off getting much more schoolwork done than I had expected, and then with the party after supper. We had the whole station over after supper for snacks and a game. We played a modified version of Taboo (if you've heard of that) with words that had something to do with me.

School continues to go very well today as I have almost finished an entire week of English in the last hour.  <a href="http://www.xanga.com/razamoda">Chels</a> gets to chat tomorrow, and I'm thinking of calling her on Saturday, so I'm quite happy right now <img class="emote" src="http://www.xanga.com/images/happy.gif" />
