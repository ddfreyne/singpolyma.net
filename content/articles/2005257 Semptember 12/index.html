Coming to mid-september I am still waiting for my school books to arrive, which means I'll be very behind in some courses.  However, I hope to get the materials next week, so then I'll be working to catch up.  I am also trying to stay 'on top of' the SC this year, as much as that be humanly possible.  I've decided not to tag my posts on here anymore... it takes a lot of time and all it does is make them easier for complete strangers to find.  And what stranger cares that my books haven't arrived yet?
