<blockquote>The free culture movement is a social movement that promotes the freedom to distribute and modify creative works, using the Internet as well as other media. <cite><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Culture_movement">Wikipedia</a></cite></blockquote>
There are a number of things that get associated with the term "Free Culture" and a number of reasons people support them.  Let me start with what I <strong>do not</strong> support:
<ul>
	<li>I do not support the rampant piracy of music, or the triumph over the RIAA through <a href="http://blogs.itworldcanada.com/insights/2008/08/05/unauthorized-music-filesharing/">possible loopholes</a>.</li>
	<li>While current copyright laws and enforcement practices are counterproductive and unfair, I see this an a separate issue to Free Culture.</li>
	<li>I do not support Free Culture just because I believe in Freedom (although I do).</li>
	<li>I do not support "mix culture" that thrives on living just as close as they can to the Fair Dealings (/ Fair Use) lines just because they want to use the content without paying.</li>
</ul>
If these things, to me, are <strong>not</strong> Free Culture, then what is?

First, it's been beaten to death but I must say it: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_Libre">libre is not gratis</a>.  When I talk about Free Culture, I'm not talking about not paying for things.  A lot of Free Culture is available gratis, but also some is not: and I have been willing to pay / donate to even those that are available at no cost.

<strong>I support free culture because a harmonic culture is a strong culture.</strong> Let me expand on that.  Harmonics are those things which reinforce each other.  Musical melodies can be harmonic, and that is the most common context for the term.  A culture in which <span class="haudio"> <span class="vcard contributor"> <a class="url fn" href="http://musicbrainz.org/artist/2f569e60-0a1b-4fb9-95a4-3dc1525d1aad.html">The Backstreet Boys</a> </span> sing <a class="url title uid" href="http://musicbrainz.org/release/d1fc0c1b-9211-42b1-9ad1-1edd93bd86ff.html">I Want it That Way</a> </span> is alright.  Artists can create original works and distribute them.  But a culture in which <span class="haudio"> <span class="vcard contributor"> <a class="url fn" href="http://musicbrainz.org/artist/7746d775-9550-4360-b8d5-c37bd448ce01.html">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a> </span> can then sing <a class="url title uid" href="http://musicbrainz.org/track/944144b4-170f-4a6c-af85-bbb5964ca6e5.html">eBay</a> </span> reinforces itself.  Culture builds on culture.

Nothing new here, and many would point to the infringing mix culturists and say that's what they're trying to do.  But by mixing <strong>locked</strong> culture, often <strong>illigally</strong> they hurt the cause and their art form.  I support Free Culture not because I want to see more mixes, but because <strong>I want to see more things that can be mixed</strong>.  To me, that is free, no-strings-attached permission to build on your work.  If you make a song, I make a video.  You make a cartoon, I include it in a documentary.  It's not the building on that is important, though, but <strong>having things to build on at all.</strong>

Some Free Culturists want to acheive this goal by making more lax <a href="http://whatiscopyright.org">copyright laws</a>.  This is a fine goal, but is ultimately the wrong solution.  While having more Fair Dealings allowances and content entering the Public Domain faster gives us greater access to our culture - even more can be done by licensing works <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">freely</a> now.

The great benefit to this model is it <strong>helps artists</strong> who are creating work <strong>right now</strong>, not only to have a rich community to draw from, but also to market themselves at all.  In a traditional copyright model, everything hinges on expensive licenses, equiptment, and lawyers protecting it all.  If you open yourself up to <a href="http://ccmixter.org/">unrelenting remixing</a>, and <a href="http://jamendo.com">business models</a> that <a href="http://bradsucks.com">cut out</a> the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_four_record_labels">middle men</a> (and this applies well outside of music) you can interact with the fans/consumers more directly and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Inch_Nails#Ghosts_I.E2.80.93IV"><strong>make as much or more money doing it</strong></a>.  All without selling your rights or giving someone else a chance to meddle in what you do best: being the artist.
