It looks like <a href="http://www.xanga.com/razamoda">Chels</a> will be coming back in three weeks or less probably <img class="emote" src="http://www.xanga.com/images/laughing.gif" />  She's only about a week and a half behind as of now <img class="emote" src="http://www.xanga.com/images/laughing.gif" /><img class="emote" src="http://www.xanga.com/images/laughing.gif" />  Can you tell I'm happy? <img class="emote" src="http://www.xanga.com/images/laughing.gif" /><img class="emote" src="http://www.xanga.com/images/laughing.gif" /><img class="emote" src="http://www.xanga.com/images/laughing.gif" />

What else is going on with me personally? Umm... I have a load of French homework to do because I forgot to do last week's, so I have two weeks at once <img class="emote" src="http://www.xanga.com/images/silly.gif" /> Power is going off in five mintues so I have to hurry up and finish this. I seem to be concentrating much better on my schoolwork, and I'd like to thank everyone for praying <img class="emote" src="http://www.xanga.com/images/happy.gif" /> I still get distracted enough to find the occasional piece of interesting web content to go on my <a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/">tech blog</a>, but school is not dragging on me like it was.

Not much else just now, just thought I'd pop off a quick update. Oh, and who would be interested in subscribing to this blog via email? If anyone. Just curious...
