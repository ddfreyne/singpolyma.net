In line with <a href="/2009/05/rel-prev-next-wordpress/" rel="reference">my last post</a> I have also created a plugin that adds &lt;link&gt; tags to your &lt;head&gt; section on appropriate pages for rel=first and rel=last, attributes that allow browsers and others to easily discover the first and last page in a set of pages.

The plugin also provides utility functions for getting this information so that you can add human-visible &lt;a&gt; tags, if you prefer.
