Tired of working with pages that do not have Microformats support yet?  The <a href="http://xoxotools.ning.com/proxy/">Microformats Proxy</a> is the tool for the job.  Individual or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globbing">globbed</a> URLs can be set up via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xpath">XPath</a> to extract data and format it as microformats.  In this first version only hCards are supported.

All existing hCards and XOXO data are also maintained.
