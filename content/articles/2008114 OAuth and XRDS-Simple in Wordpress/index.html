I'm publishing two plugins today.  The first is pretty simple in what it can do for users directly - the <a href="/plugins/xrds-simple/">XRDS-Simple</a> plugin allows users to delegate their OpenID to their Wordpress blog - basically letting you log in on OpenID enabled sites using your blog address, but without needing to run your own provider.

On a far geekier level, the plugin allows other plugins to add <a href="http://xrds-simple.net">XRDS-Simple services</a> and other information (such as OAuth Discovery) using a progammatic API.  A brief example of this API is on the plugin's page.

I am also releasing a more DiSo related plugin - <a href="/plugins/oauth/">WP-OAuth</a>.  This plugin enables interacting with Wordpress authentication using <a href="http://oauth.net/">the open OAuth protocol</a>.  This could be exciting if combined with AtomPub or another protocol / format supported by Wordpress or another plugin.
