So here's my Christmas summary update post, as promised and earlier than I expected to do it.  Perhaps a day-by-day?  Why not, lol

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Christmas Eve</span>
Christmas Eve evening we had the whole station and Aunt Mary Stone and Aunt Joy Hart all in our house for a meal.  Big meal.  We had tacos and ice cream and chocolate and cookies and crackers and cheddar cheese and summer sausage.  Lots of it.  Very full, very fun.  Then we played a game where we had to decode the names of christmas songs from really weird language (like "Miniscule Male Master of Precussionistic Cylinders") and another one that was kind of like password but with Christmas words.  All the time we were playing we were eating candy.  A missionary family we know that's on furlough in the US right now sent out a whole bunch of goodies, so that's what we were eating, hehe.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Christmas Day</span>
Coming in two parts, so let's start with stockings and presents.  I GOT A WEBCAM!!!!  YAY!  It's totally kewl, even if my connectin can barely handle it.  I got <span style="font-style: italic;">The Incredibles</span> too, hope to watch it soon :D  Got a couple books too "It's Not About Me" by Max Lucado and "White" by Ted Dekker.

Lunch was at Ezels.  More food!  Stufing and ham and turkey and mashed potatoes.  They have two toddler-types and a lil baby.  Emme!  she's soooo cute, hehe.  She rips my hair out and grabs my glasses, but that's easily forgivable, hehe... lotsa fun. 

Oh, part three of Christmas Day (I know I said two, but who cares? ;P), we had a bonfire!  Lotsa fun, sit by the fire and, guess what? EAT!  More candy and cookies and crackers and REAL (ie, cheddar) cheese and summer sausage.  Got to hold Emme a lot, funfun, hehe :D  roast mellows and do riddles and listen to my bro with the guitar. awesome stuff.

hope you all enjoyed your christmas as much as i did mine! :D
