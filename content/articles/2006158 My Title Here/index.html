<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On? Going? Going on? Is something going on? I realy ought to post whether something is or not... ;) I don't post nearly often enough here. <a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/">My techblog</a> got two posts in ten minutes the other day, and I leave my personal blog weeks without a thing happening? Hardly fair. But I do a lot more techie stuff than not! ;) In fact, just to be unfair, I'm gonna have a techie thingy later in this post. Why? You'll see. But anyway.

School is over. Finito. Complet. All gone, bye bye, whoo see ya! I didn't get the stunning stellar grade point that I have in the past, but I didn't flunk anything by a long shot! (Except physics which was kinda close...) My diploma is in the mail and I have probably less than a month of access to NSA's servers. Scary thought, that. We had a little grad party which I was dragged to against my will. <a href="http://digerbop.blogspot.com/2006/06/done.html">Dan posted more about that</a>. My book is coming along well, and while it's a far cry from the 'done' I thought I might be able to pull off by the end of June, it is probably about half done. I think I may have actually hit something close to resembling publishible quality if I polish this. Not that that means anything, except that I am very satisfied with my own work :)

Techy part. For any of you who blog in any capacity, using any service. Yes, even (and perhaps especially) you Xangans! I'm <a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/2006/06/survey-perfect-blogging-service.html">running a survey</a> on my tech blog about the perfect blogging service. I know you Xangans think yours <i>is</i> the perfect blogging service, but bear with me ;) I would greatly appreciate your answering the servey and saying what features (that Xanga has, or doesn't have) you would like most in your blog service. It will be great to get feedback from the more teenage-personal-blogger / Xanga side of the line as well as from the give-me-code-or-give-me-death side ;)
