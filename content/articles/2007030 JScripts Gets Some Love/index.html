<a href="http://jscripts.ning.com/">JScripts</a>, my Ning app for storing JavaScript includes,  has got some upgrades!  At <a href="http://ecmanaut.blogspot.com/">Johan</a>'s prodding I have added the following:
<ul><li>Include multiple JavaScripts with just one request to save time!  It even <a href="http://jscripts.ning.com/ids/">has a form</a>!</li><li>Tack ?minify on to a script to have JScripts compress it before transfer (more time saving!)</li><li>Tack ?callback=whoever on to have whoever() called after the script has loaded</li></ul>
