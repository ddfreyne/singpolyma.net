I was watching a TV show about animals yesterday (okay, okay, it was recorded and ancient).  Very full of Evolution, but i noticed something interesting.  Three times in the show someone mentioned how something was 'desgined'.  Bird's beaks are all 'specially designed' for the kind of food they eat, and their bodies are 'specially designed' for flying, whereas humans just aren't 'designed' for flying.  Amazing... even the Evolutionists trip over their own logic.
