This is a good quote, too long for an excerpt.
<blockquote><cite><a href="http://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=134688&amp;cid=11244104">Slashdot - perky</a>
</cite>Things I want on a phone:
    1. Small
    2. Lots of space for contacts
    3. Synch with Outlook
    4. Some flash memory with a USB socket, like a USB memory stick
    5. Well designed UI
    6. Good audio quality
    7. Shold look recognisably like a phone
    8. Predictive text

    Things I don't want on a phone:
    1. Camera
    2. Video camera
    3. Games
    4. Audio recorder
    5. mini qwerty keyboard
    6. flashlight
    7. GPS
    8. Compass
    9. Microsoft Office
    10. A meda player

    Things that are acceptable as long as they don't get in the way:
    1. GPRS
    2. Some kind of WAP/internet thing
    3. Bluetooth
    4. a Java runtime                </blockquote>Someone is  thinking, who wants a camara in a phone anyway???  Some of this  stuff is okay, but some of it is rediculous!  I must admit I have  used some of these features on my dad's phone, but they didn't work  really well.  What we <i>really</i> need is a PDA that works as a  phone, not a phone that works as a PDA.  Incidentally, why did he  want it to sync with Outlook?  Outlook is pretty much useless and  is getting worse every release.
