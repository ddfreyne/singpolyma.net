The <a href="http://microformats.org/mailman/listinfo/microformats-discuss">microformats-discuss</a> mailing list reached an impossible <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio#Informal_use">signal/noise ratio</a> for me awhile back.  My inbox was just too flooded with discussions I did not find interesting and I archived 90% of it without even opening it.  Well, today I went browsing through the archives and here is some of the interesting stuff I found summarised for those of you with similar issues:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-discuss/2007-February/008463.html">Scope was discussed again</a>, some arguing that rel-tag needs to be defined as to where it applies.  The upshot (which I fully support) was <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-tag-faq#What_about_Scope.3F">documented on the wiki</a>.</li>
	<li>There was some discussion surrounding <a href="http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-discuss/2007-February/008487.html">microformats detection and false-positives</a>.  Discussion concerned using the profile attribute of HTML to get around this, but since parsers should check for validity of uF as well as root class existence, it shouldn't really be a problem.</li>
	<li>There is a <a href="http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-discuss/2007-February/008530.html">bit of ongoing discussion</a> which I do not 100% grok.  It could have to do with saying an hCard is for the owner of a page, but that is determined by whether or not it is in an
<address> element.  It could have to do with two hCards being for the same person, in which case I agree that class=url, rel=me on both of them pointing to each other demonstrates that very well.  Or it may have to do with seeing if an hCard is useful at all... I don't get that.</address></li>
	<li>There was some discussion caused by the announcement of <a href="http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-discuss/2007-February/008580.html">Videntity's hCard and XFN integration</a> (yay!)  Great potential there.</li>
	<li>There was the <a href="http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-discuss/2007-February/008690.html">age-old 'my rel-tag URLs are crap' issue</a> brought on by a Blogger-FTP issue.  The Blogger problem makes sense and probably will not be 'resolved' except by removing rel=tag from FTP blogs.  Blogger-FTP is crap.</li>
	<li>Someone questioned the <a href="http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-discuss/2007-February/008639.html">value of XOXO itself</a>!  They were kindly directed here ;)</li>
	<li>There is a <a href="http://www.xfront.com/microformats/AHAH.html">presentation (S3!) about AHAH</a>.  Of course, AHAH is built on AJAX and thus subject to cross-domain issues.  They need a JSONP version.</li>
	<li>Finally, another bit on <a href="http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-discuss/2007-February/008783.html">proving two hCards are for the same person</a>.  In a more dangerous way.</li>
</ul>
