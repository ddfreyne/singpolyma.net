This week I was horrified when @<a href="http://twitter.com/adityavm">adityavm</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/adityavm/statuses/775490255">moved from</a> the most evil of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> licenses (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">BY-NC-ND</a>) to <a href="http://whatiscopyright.org">All Rights Reserved</a>.  As an advocate of free culture I began to realize just how dangerous it can be to walk that evil line of just-barely-free.  I took a long, hard look at my own licensing practices and decided it was time to open up.  All previous and future entries on my blog (unless otherwise noted) are now licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/ca/">CC-BY</a>.  Let freedom reign!
