So we just got back from a trip to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%27Djamena">N'Djamena</a>, the capital of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad">Chad</a>. We went up on Monday and got back yesterday. I got a lot of schoolwork done on Tuesday and Wednesday, but none on the other days, so I'm going to have to catch up some again.

It was my Mom's birthday while we were up there, so we went out to eat. I had the 'sausage plate', which was two sausages and loads of fries. The Symons were up there too and met us at the restaurant kind of as a surprise. It was as fun as restaurants ever are... but they gave us menus and made us decide what we wanted to eat, and then we waited like half an hour for our food so 'fun' is a relative term <img src="http://www.xanga.com/images/silly.gif" class="emote" />.

I got to be secondary technical advisor to the Field Council, which was fun. What exactly does that mean? It means Dad thought they needed to upgrade their computer system and asked me for a second opinion, hehe.

We also were invited to the Hildebrand's (don't ask me how to spell that <img src="http://www.xanga.com/images/silly.gif" class="emote" />), they're a MAF couple and one of the few other Canadian families in the country.  We had a mini-thanksgiving celebration since it was about that time and we were Canadians together.

My brother spent most of the trip playing pinball.  I spent most of it wishing it were over (partly from missing <a href="http://www.xanga.com/buhler_buhler_buhler">Chels</a>, partly from missing the Internet in general, and partly because I <i>hate</i> vacations).  I went shopping on the last day, when Dad's meetings were finally over, and that was the only enjoyable shopping trip I've ever been on!  I think it's because I was actually buying something....  Anyway, not much else to report except to except that I have some new stuff up on my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/singpolyma/">Flickr</a>.
