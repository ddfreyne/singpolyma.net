If you haven't heard of <a href="http://videntity.org/">Videntity</a>, you may recognize it as the major force behind my landing page.  If you don't have an <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a>, you can get one from Videntity.  If you have one already (like me) you can log in using it.

Then, you can associate a profile with your OpenID.  Yes, you've done this a million times before.  Videntity is different -- you can actually import your existing profile from elsewhere if it is done using <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard">hCard</a>.

You can also add friends to your profile on Videntity.  Here again, the service is different.  You are not bound to adding people who have ever used Videntity -- anyone with a URL can be added.  Full <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/xfn">XFN</a> vocabulary is supported.  This powers the primary friends list on my home page.

Enter the bookmarklet.  I have written a bookmarklet that works cross-browser.  Click it, and it detects hCards and Facebook links on the current page.  It presents you with a list of these people it has detected and lets you either click over to their profile (useful in itself) or add them to your Videntity profile as friends.

So, drag the following to your bookmark bar and watch the magic!

<a href="javascript:(function(){var js = document.createElement('script'); js.type = 'text/javascript'; js.src = 'http://singpolyma.googlepages.com/videntity-bookmarklet.js'; document.body.appendChild(js);})();">Videntity Bookmarklet</a>
