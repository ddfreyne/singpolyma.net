An update on my life over the past weekend.   Saturday - Workshop.  Sunday - Not much.  Today - Chels indefinately grounded.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Workshop</span>
This saturday <a href="http://www.teamchad.org/Palmview/">Palmview</a> had their second woodworking workshop. For me this meant going and watching everyone else make shelves. Why only watching you ask? Well, enough wood was only relegated for <a href="http://digerbop.blogspot.com/">Daniel</a> and myself to share a project, and he had an idea for something he would use. I didn't. So I let him take all the wood and basically just go and hang out because it is required of me. I had a lot of fun helping Angela (the Symons' baby sister) walk back and for across the car pit. She would step one foot out onto the board across the pit and then reach out her hand and I would put out my hand and she'd grab one of my fingers. Then she'd walk over. Eventually she decided holding my fingers was cool enough and just dragged me all over the place. 'Twas a lot of fun.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Not Much</span>
Uh.... ya... got up, went to church, came home, went to the pool, came home, went to church, came home, went to bed. Mostly came home <img src="http://www.xanga.com/images/winky.gif" class="emote" />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Chels Indefinately Grounded</span>
Not fun  <img src="http://www.xanga.com/images/silly.gif" class="emote" /> Today Chels' parents found out how far behind in school she is (approximately three weeks) and indefinately grounded her from having any contact at all with myself, <a href="http://xanga.com/bugaroo777">Stef</a>, <a href="http://xanga.com/zedlander">Trev</a>, et al online. This has had multiple effects. (1) I miss her already, pathetic but true. (2) I am now more scared of her father than ever before. I just hope this all goes well and that I can survive the indefinate period of time... *sigh*
