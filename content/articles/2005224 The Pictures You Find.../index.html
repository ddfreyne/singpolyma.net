<img style="border: 0px none ; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;" src="huanying.jpg" alt="Welcome" />Image left - Welcome in Chinese... well, I can't read Chinese, so I'm trustig <a href="http://haomafan.com">Ian</a> that's what it says...  I got it from him awhile back to add chinese to the many languages I have welcome in on my <a href="http://spweber.4x2.net">home page</a>.  I haven't got around to it yet... and I just found the picture again and went 'oh yeah!'. <img style="border: 0px none ; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6537/1341/320/StainedGlass.jpg" alt="" />

Image right - NSAers will recognise it from my rez. It's a piece of 'artwork' i created eons ago by drastically distorting an already bad picture of myself. Why I still have it is beyond me... maybe I thought it was worth keeping? Who knows, I'll keep it until I decide ;P<img style="border: 0px none ; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;" src="UglyMug.jpg" alt="" />
Image left again - more of my lovely boredom in an image editor ;P  again, rather old, few people have even seen this image ;P
