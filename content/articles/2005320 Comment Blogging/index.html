On some 'closed' blogging / forum services there are present some features you cannot, present, find elsewhere. One of the most prominent of these is the ability to see all comments by a particular user. Some people have decided to overcome this problem by<a href="http://dosemagazine.blogsome.com/2005/01/05/mycomments-feed-back-to-myblog/"> posting their comments to del.icio.us</a>.  Johan Sundstr√∂m at <a href="http://ecmanaut.blogspot.com/">ecmanaut</a> has <a href="http://ecmanaut.blogspot.com/2005/11/comment-blogging-tool-for-blogger.html">come up with a Greasemonkey script</a> to automate the process.  This then allows you to have an RSS feed and aggregation page (powered nicely by <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>) for all comments you place on other people's blogs, and even to publish all or some of these comments to your sidebar. I fully agree with the concept here, however I believe that using del.icio.us in this manner is counterproductive, for a few reasons :
<ol>   <li>Del.icio.us is about posting URLs, comments are content with often no proper URL themselves</li>   <li>Del.icio.us is about tagging, and while there is much useful metadata that can be associated with a comment, I see little or no use in tagging it</li>   <li>Because del.icio.us is not meant for this application, many features that would be useful to comments are not and will never be implemented (see below)</li> </ol> Viewing all comments by a particular person is certianly a useful option, even including comments posted on their own blog, however a way to filter them to just on other people's blogs would be useful. Following all comments on a particular post is certianly also a useful option, since so many bloggers are forced to reply to comments via their blog <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> via email to make sure the reply is received. Following all comments for a particular blog would also be useful. While some of these features are already provided by some blogging platforms / services, they are rarely all offered and rarely in a conveniant way.

What we truly need is a new service, one that tracks comments (and possible trackbacks) from all blogs just as is being done now by those posting to del.icio.us. It could provide feeds and aggregation pages for all the features I've listed above, and probably many I haven't thought of. Aggregation could also be merged in-service to one page / feed, much like the del.icio.us inbox, so that you could add posts / blogs to monitor the comments of without overcrowding your feedreader with feeds for old posts or even for all the blogs you comment on. A single feed is much more conveniant for such practise.

Johan's Greasemonkey script could easily be modified to work with such a service instead of with del.icio.us, and independant bloggers could even integrate the comment-to-commentblogger link directly into their 'your comment has been posted' pages. Eventually, services like Blogger could theoretically even allow you to store your commentblogger username and password in your account and auto-post all your comments to your commentblogger account.
