So first, the plugin.  I have basically ported the <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/2008/01/building_action_streams.html">MT Actionstream</a> plugin <a href="/plugins/actionstream/">to Wordpress </a>(you can see it in action on my main page).  This is pretty cool, and it means we can easily share settings with other efforts.

New in this release is the ability to import a list of services from another page (like MyBlogLog or  FriendFeed) using <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/socialgraph/">SGAPI</a>.

Code lesson: sometimes the Wordpress docs lie.  They say that you pass a function name (or array with object reference and function name) to wp-cron hooks to schedule regular actions.  Not true.  You pass the name of a Wordpress action (added with add_action).

Blogging Lesson: Blog your own work.  This plugin has been covered by at least four blogs now (more than most of my stuff) and not yet by me.  I just posted the plugin on the DiSo mailing list and people liked it.  I'm not complaining, but I'll definately post my own stuff up front in the future!
