We need a unified and federated status system.  Something so simple, it should be easy to federate.

Why?  Because right now I set my 'status' (ie, what I'm doing, a small tidbit to share) on my Jabber account, <a href="http://twitter.com/singpolyma/">my Twitter account</a>, and my Facebook account.  If I were a member in more places I'd be doing it more.  There needs to be a way to set it in one place and then propagate it.

But wait!  We <em>do</em> have a standard, federated system for this!  Jabber/XMPP itself is a presence (that includes status) protocol.  How could this be made to work?  Rather easily.

Already anything I say to the Twitter bot from Jabber goes into my Twitter.  What SHOULD happen is that whenever I change my Jabber status THAT goes into my Twitter.   Facebook could easily create a similar bridge.
