This is (more than) a note to inform all of you that I have posted more pictures on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/singpolyma">my Flickr</a> (yes, even more since you last went <a href="http://www.xanga.com/razamoda">Chels</a> <img class="emote" src="http://www.xanga.com/images/winky.gif" alt=";)" />).  And of course the routine usual update on my life since I haven't done one in awhile :

So... what's happening with me?  I'm inclined to say nothing... but something must be happening because I feel busy....  The <a href="http://boxtheweb.4x2.net/">BoxtheWeb</a> project launched public the other day, which has kept me hopping with bugs et al and I'm not close to there yet... oh well, it works well enough for my brother, he keeps telling me not to change it, it's just fine ;P Also the omnipresent schoolwork is around, trying to keep me busy... instead I usually get distracted cause I don't want to do it so I fall behind :P Right now I am sitting on the computer (not literally <img class="emote" src="http://www.xanga.com/images/silly.gif" alt=":P" />) waiting, hoping Chels will come on before I have to go...  The <a href="http://www.teamchad.org/Printshop/index.html">PrintShop</a> started printing the Agenda today (finally! whew!) so that is over.

Just a quick note to those of you who use multiple IM services or often wish you could connect from places where you cannot download IM clients... or both! <a href="http://meebo.com/">Meebo</a> is a nice service that will let you connect to all major IM clients at the same time from within your webbrowser! They do not store your data and all password transmissions are 1024-bit encrypted (which may cause some browsers to give a warning, because it is a CPU-hogging script to do that encryption <img class="emote" src="http://www.xanga.com/images/silly.gif" alt=":P" />, just click 'cancel' and let the script run if this happens.... it won't unless you have an old computer).
