For those wondering what all the garbage comments are on the previous post, it was Trev and I trying to get a <a href="http://www.mailbucket.org/spcomments.xml">comments feed</a> for my blog.  We got it working (using <a href="http://www.mailbucket.org/">mailbucket</a>) and for those of you who use RSS it is now available under the 'Syndicate' header in the sidebar.  Pairing this feed with <a href="http://feeddigest.com">feeddigest</a> I have inserted a 'Recent Comments' section into the sidebar on the main page, replacing the 'Recent Posts' section (since on the main page you're seeing recent posts anyway). On the other pages the 'Recent Posts' section shows up again. Currently only the five most recent comments show up in the sidebar, but I would like feedback as to how many is useful. Clicking on one of the links will take you to a page with the full text of the comment, including a link to the post it was put on so you can reply.
