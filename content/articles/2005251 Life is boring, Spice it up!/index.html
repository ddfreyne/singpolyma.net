Yes, life has again become routine. School/IM in the mornings, programming/chat in the afternoons, and maybe some time with the kids on the station in there somewhere. Nothing much interesting happening. I had another person contact me today about mNEWS that wants to use it, so that's kewl. Maybe with the donation links at the bottom of all these mNEWS emails I'll get enough donations to pay for my hosting account <img src="http://www.xanga.com/images/winky.gif" class="emote" />.  Found an interesting site the other day.  <a href="http://shouldexist.org/">ShouldExist.org</a> is basically a place where thinkers put their ideas in the hopes that implementors will be interested.  Kinda a kewl idea.
