I am moving my primary WordPress plugins' hosting to the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/">WordPress Plugins Database</a>. This means listings and extra exposure too!  Links to their home there will appear on their home page here.

<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/videntity/">The Videntity plugin already has a home there</a>.
