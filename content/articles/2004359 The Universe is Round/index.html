Some say the universe is expanding, others say that it is static, but I say the universe is round!

Something cannot, within the physical universe, be infinite. It must have some defined limits. Now God is infinite and could have made the physical universe infinite, and thus some believe. However why did he not then make other infite things. Others say the universe is expaning, and this also is possible. However, I think that the universe is round.

If you take a single dimension (a mathematical line or line segment) and fold it, what do you get? Well, it depends how you fold it. If you fold it <i>into</i> itself, it will become a ray or a  shorter line segment.  But how about folding  <i>onto</i> itself? It will have to gain a dimension so that you can specify where the two parts are in relation to each other, it will have become <i>second dimensional</i>.

The point of this is that I am not claiming the universe is a normal three-dimensional round. I think it is either fourth or fifth dimensionally round. All this means is that we have a way of determining where all points are in absolute relation to each other, but you cannot 'exit' the universe and go over the edge. What would be beyond the edge? Nothing? That's imposible. God then? I think that is silly. I find it much easier to understand what would be outside if we say there is no way to get outside. Which implies infinity or roundness. However we know there is something outside, for there are other universes (that of the angels and heaven and perhaps others). Therefor if we see the universe as round, then we can see these universes as space, inaccesible by any ordinary means. Any means that would allow us to do this would seem to us supernatural, and so it is.
