  User-interface experts at one of the world's top design houses say Mac OS X Tiger is the beginning of the end for the Macintosh Finder -- the era of organizing files in nested folders is over.</blockquote>
  Experts at Silicon Valley's frog design say new features like the systemwide Spotlight search are far more useful for locating information than the hierarchy of files and folders that underpins most computing interfaces, whether on Macs or Windows-based PCs.

That has got to be the stupidest thing I have ever heard...  search has been a part of computing since the dir (or ls) command in MSDOS/Unix before GUI existed... but so has folders!  When I first saw this headline I thought that maybe they were proposing a flat system like the tags on delicious or something of that nature... but this is just dumb... search cannot replace organisation, as evidenced by the continued popularity of places like the Google Directory... would any user of the Google Directory argue that Google search will make the directory obsolete?  Of course not!  Search came first with Google!
