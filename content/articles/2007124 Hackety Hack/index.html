<a href="http://hacketyhack.net/"><img style="float:left;" title="Hacky Mouse" src="App-64x64.png" alt="Hacky Mouse" width="64" height="64" /></a>Have you read <a href="http://whytheluckystiff.net/articles/theLittleCodersPredicament.html">The Little Coder's Predicament</a>?  Similar articles have been published, and rambling on the positive and negative side has occurred here, but I must say that I side with _why on this issue : <a href="http://hacketyhack.net/manifesto/">hacking is just not accessible</a> to children and non-geeks like it used to be.

The solution?  Many have been proposed, including one that was named after _why's article (<a href="http://www.danceliquid.com/LittleCoder/">LittleCoder</a>).  Now, _why and friends are pushing forward a whyware project to end the issue forever : <a href="http://hacketyhack.net/">Hackey Hack</a>.  The program (Windows-only for now, but that will change) gives simple kid-and-non-geek-friendly lessons on the Ruby programming language, while simultaneously allowing users to experiment (a.k.a. hack) to their heart's content.

_why, whoever he may be, has also switched his blogging venue and topic.  He is now running <a href="http://hackety.org/">hackety.org</a> as a blog about hacking and code as art in general.

This is a really exciting project, and one I hope to make use of and see used in a big way!
