"...i'm afraid most people would automatically do .com..."

Is the whole web going  dot-com?  That domain is for businesses, yet everyone seems to use  it, why?  Dot-com is no more legitimate than anything else.   Even obviously non-profit sites have COMs (i.e. <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">getfirefox.<i>com</i></a>, under <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">mozilla.<i>org</i></a>).  And individuals have them as well (<a href="http://www.ryanrahn.com/">ryanrahn.<i>com</i></a>).   For individuals dot-net makes sense, or a region specific domain (.us,  .ca, .de) but again, dot-com makes no sense.  Sure we have an  e-business explosion, but why should we steal all the commercial  domains?
