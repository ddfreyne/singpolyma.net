I knew <a href="http://www.wired.com/software/webservices/news/2007/08/open_social_net">others were talking</a> about distributed social networking, but <a href="http://factoryjoe.com/">Messina</a> is <a href="http://factoryjoe.pbwiki.com/DistributedSocialNetwork">working on code</a>, and even code for Wordpress!  The Kilroy concept (an "I was here" plugin) looks excellent.  Avatars looks like exactly what I've been saying I should do since I installed Gravatars on this blog.  The contactlist plugin looks like basically <a href="http://factorycity.net/projects/wp-microformatted-blogroll/">what I have here (his code, I believe)</a>, but I've hacked mine some.  His delegation looks a lot like what I want to add to my XRDS plugin.  Pempeth would go great with his contact form concept.

Other cool stuff there too -- overall just excited that things seem to be picking up a bit in this field -- I'm writing some bookmarklets just now, and really should clean and release some of the remaining WordPress code.
