Today I received a threat from Facebook about an old F8 app of mine called "The Wall" because it was designed to look identical to the Facebook wall (back when that was a separate area of one's profile) but actually tie data back to a datastore on one's own website. (Only <span class="vcard tag"><a class="fn url" href="http://opher.ca">Chris Shiels</a></span> ever used it).

They claim to have a trademark on the word "wall". I wonder what the superwall people (or anyone with the Unix command "wall" installed, which is where Facebook got the name from in the first place) are going to do.

The email is below:

<blockquote>
