 Just FYI to my readers - I cannot access the Blogger posting interface.  This has been a problem on and off for the last six months and seems to be a problem with my ISP.  I've used a proxy to get around it in the past, but Blogger's new security features make that not work.

I can edit my template, but I can't edit my posts.  I'm posting this from Flock.  Flock does not support Blogger labels, and thus all I am getting are Technorati links in my post footer.  Old posts that should be updated with new information cannot be.  I will try to do some of that from school, but I cannot from home.

I apologise for the inconvenience.
