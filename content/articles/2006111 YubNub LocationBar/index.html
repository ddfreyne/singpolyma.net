My <a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/2006/04/yubnub-toolbar.html">previous YubNub extension</a> suffered from several glitches. While it was useful, it annoyed me enough to get me to research a new format. So I have written a new extension. This one functions a little differently and so I will leave the old one up. This extension modifies the standard FireFox location bar to support <a href="http://yubnub.org">YubNub</a> commands. If the entered text is determined to be a URL the location bar will function as normal, otherwise the text is passed to YubNub. No more second bar, no more glitchy locationbar behaviour, just straight YubNub integration. All YubNub commands will work, including single-word commands without parameters.

<strong title="Update 2006-04-24">Version 0.11 has been released which fixes a glitch that broke access to about:config and typeing some javascript: URLs</strong>

<strong title="2006-04-25">Version 0.12 has been released which fixes a flitch that caused commands that are passed URLs not to work</strong>

<strong title="2006-04-26">Version 0.13 has been released which adds a command history feature. Simply push your up/down arrow keys while in the location bar to access the command history.</strong>

<strong title="2006-08-08">Version 0.14 has been released which fixes some minor bugs with navigating to local IPs, and also allows defined FireFox keyword bookmarks to supercede YubNub commands.</strong>

<strong title="2006-08-30">Version 0.15 has been released which has some minor improvements to the look and feel of the extension, and also now allows local firefox bookmarks to use switches (using the same syntax as YubNub proper). It also stores up to 50 commands from your command history between sessions now.</strong>

<strong title="2006-10-31">Version 0.16 has been released.  Support for non-standard URLs (such as those from <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/cult/whoNicDOffWithTheYummyJunkDomains.html">nic.d</a>. Arrow-key history navigation broke some default Firefox features, so it is now Ctrl+Arrow Key. A hackish integration with Firefox auto-complete history has also been coded. Type y: before a command to have the auto-complete work (or just to force it into YubNub mode).</strong>

<strong title="2006-11-29">Version 0.17 has been released which fixes some minor URL resolution bugs.</strong>

<stong title="2007-03-08">Version 0.19 (0.18 was released silently) fixes some minor bugs noted in the comments.  There is also now an entry <a href="http://preview.addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4625/">at mozilla</a>.  Please review there if you find this useful!
