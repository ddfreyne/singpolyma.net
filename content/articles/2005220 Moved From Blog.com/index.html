This is my first post after having moved from <a href="http://www.blog.com">blog.com</a>.  I will keep the <a href="http://spweber.blog.com/">old site</a> active for archiving purposes. This site has a completely different look and feel, as well as having no categories, but I did not think the categories a great loss to my personal blog. My <a href="http://singpolyma.blog.com/">technical blog</a> will likely remain on <a href="http://www.blog.com/">blog.com</a> for the forseeable future, as categories are more important there. I would really like comments on what you think of this whole site design/layout <img src="http://www.xanga.com/images/happy.gif" class="emote" />.
