Well it's been quite awhile since my last proper update.  So here's the lowdown on what's happening with me:

<ul>   <li>Power : is back up.  The <a href="http://www.teamchad.org/Printshop/">PrintShop</a> is running regularly again and I have gone back to using my famously buggy desktop. This means you should all start seeing me at your blogs again, since I have <a href="http://sage.mozdev.org/">my RSS reader</a> over there.</li>   <li>School : started. I am a good ways into my math and resonably into Chemistry and English. Physics and Social Studies I have barely started yet, because my books aren't here. They are supposed to be coming mid-September. Please pray for their arrival.</li>   <li><a href="http://www.teamchad.org/Palmview/">Palmview</a> : running, me teaching.  They have five students this year: <a href="http://www.xanga.com/jkweber">my sister</a>, <a href="http://authors.awriterz.org/bio.php?id=7">Janelle Hoyt</a>, Rebecca Symons (3 in grade 8), Pascal Cross (1 in grade 6), and Joseph Symons (forgive me for not remembering his grade). I am teaching a computer class (Introduction to Microsoft Office) every Friday. Please pray that I teach effectively and the kids learn <img src="http://www.xanga.com/images/happy.gif" class="emote" />
</li>   <li>Projects : <a href="http://www.awriterz.org/">Amateur Writerz</a>, <a href="http://www.awriterz.org/etcetc/openportal/">Open Portal</a>, and mNEWS.  As always I continue on as managing editor / webdesigner for <a href="http://www.awriterz.org/">Amateur Writerz</a>.  I have also recently started an opensource web portal project.  Detail can be found on the <a href="http://wikinote.com/openportal">project wiki</a> or at my <a href="http://singpolyma.blog.com/">tech blog</a>. On top of this I am running a service that I have dubbed mNEWS in which I use some of my programming skills and the fact that I have webhosting space to help missionaries send out their newsletters, especially needed as one of the <a href="http://gbim.org">missions</a> here in <a href="http://allafrica.com/chad/">Chad</a> that used to offer a similar service to their missionaries has cancelled it.</li> </ul>
