I need a feed reader that recognises different reading preferences for different feeds.

Let me back up.

There are two kinds of feeds -- feeds of content (blogs) and feeds of notifications (calendars, del.icio.us popular, digg, forums).  The first kind you want to read all of -- even if I miss checking my feeds for awhile I want to see what the blogs I read said.  I won't care tomorrow what was on del.icio.us popular today, there'll be 100 new items!

Google Reader does a great job on the first kind of feed, holding content until I read it.  Firefox's LiveBookmarks does a good job on the second kind, showing only current content.  What we need is a nice interface for both.

I've heard the new Bloglines might... perhaps I'll check it out.
