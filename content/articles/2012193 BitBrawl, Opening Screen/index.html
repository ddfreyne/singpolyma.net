It's not got a very shiny look yet, but I've got an opening screen for BitBrawl working now that lets the players join and configure their controls simultaneously.  Only one player is actually rendered once the game is started by pushing one of the configured START buttons, but it is progress!

After the game is started, the player can, as before, walk about the screen using the controls as they were configured for player 1.

The code is a bit hacky, but I'm quite excited by my progress so far!
