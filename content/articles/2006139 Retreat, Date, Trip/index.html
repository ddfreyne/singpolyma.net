<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Those extremely interested in more information on the 'retreat and date', which I will be sumarrizing here, may look at my <a href="http://digerbop.blogspot.com/2006/05/retreat-and-date.html">brother's beautiful writeup</a>. The retreat being referred to would be the Palmview School Annual Retreat. Bible study, snack, food, snack, games, snack, singing, food, fun, snack, snack... maybe I'm exaggerating about the snacks ;) Aunt Mary and her wonderful acolyte Asheley did the Bible studies (on excellence), my brother did the beautiful musicalness, and my mother did the games, snacks, etc ;) We did a bonfire, a HUGE bonfire, so that was fun. They all slept outside in tents -- not for me, no thanks! A certain someone would have to twist my arm pretty bad to get me to do that (or my parents order me :P) so I slept in my bed like a civilized person. Games included a sort of mini-golf which I totally bombed but had fun at anyway. Food included hamburgers and (wonder of wonders!) hotdogs. Plus <b>we made tie-dyed tees!</b> :D *is so happy* Mine came out with an awesome totally multi-colourishious sworl. I shall muchly be wearing <i>cet un</i> :D

Date, date... ah, yes, date! That was Aunt Mary and Asheley taking Daniel and I out to dinner. We were the chaperones ;) Think guys chaperoning girls seems backwards? Tough! teehee ;) it was a lot of fun, and Aunt Mary gave us both a copy of <i>The Prayer of Jabez</i> -- I'm mostly done mine already :D Really good book.

Trip. Fall. Spat! Wait, uh, no, not that kind of trip. I went on a day-trip with (<i>vous avez eu!</i>) Aunt Mary and Asheley yesterday. They had a meeting to decide the fate of a youth camp they've been planning. It was a good Chadian experiance for me, especially right before I leave for good. Beign√© (French for doughnuts, but these aren't quite doughnuts, we just call em that), sugared milk, peanuts, boule, and two glasses of utterly revolting tea. Not the nice red-so-much-sugar-your-teeth-rot-before-you-finish shai, but some sort of herbal coffee bitter less-sugar thing :P Ah, well, <i>on survive</i>.

I'm going to NDJ with Dad on Monday for one week, and may or may not be out of contact during that time -- I have no idea. Going to have a peek at their computer system <i>et chose comme sa</i>, haha. Have I totally annoyed you with all the French thrown into this post? rofl, sorry, still in semi-french mode from yesterday ;) I'm sure you'll all live -- if any of you even read this. With Chels grounded and Trev busy I probably just have the occasional visit (which I know I have, but it's not regular), but anyway, yup, uh huh, yayayayayayaya -- lol, you'd have to see the movie ;)

Until I see you or see you not or post or email or chat/IM + write again I shall not have, uh, done any of that... ya, teehee :D
