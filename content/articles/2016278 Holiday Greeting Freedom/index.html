This year I've been working on a new project for cultural freedom.  I have adapted several freely-licensed characters and visual art for use on greeting cards.  Starting with greeting cards targeting Christmas and the winter holidays generally my plan is to take orders throughout October so that cards can be printed and shipped to people in November (in plenty of time to mail them out to the intended recipients before December 25th!)

I have cards representing art from several different artists in the commons, including David Revoy's <cite>Pepper &amp; Carrot</cite> comic, Nina Paley's <cite>Mimi and Eunice</cite>, Piti Yindee's <cite>Wuffle</cite>, and the Blender Institute's <cite>Caminandes</cite> (specifically the most recent wintery episode).  This is a unique opportunity to support these artists and help Free Culture get more awareness.

Because this art is all found in the commons, I can produce these cards without needing any special contract with the original creators.  No extra legal work or permission needed, I can produce these on the strength of the Creative Commons Attribution and Zero licenses of the sources.  However, because I believe in supporting the work that enabled me, all revenue above expenses will be donated directly to the original creators (I'm not even keeping a cut for myself).

So <a href="https://libremas.singpolyma.net/">hurry to get in your order</a>, either with a greeting you like, or you can order a blank version if you prefer to write everything yourself.
