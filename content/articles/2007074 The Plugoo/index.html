Some of you have been advantaged by the Plugoo widget in my sidebar that lets you chat with me.  If I am offline it emails me.  There is one problem with this -- many of you do not leave your email address.  If I cannot contact you, how can I answer the question?  To answer some of the recent unsigned queries:

My translate widget is by a friend, <a href="http://trevorcreech.com/">Trevor Creech</a>.  See my <a href="/credits/">credits</a>.

Someone is having trouble with peek-a-boo widgets.  Most of those have recently been updated -- try the new versions and if it still doesn't work contact me and tell me which one you're using and how to contact you :)
