<a href="/pempeth/">Pempeth</a> is the result of my work based on my <a href="/2007/07/rest-personal-message-tep/">previous private messaging TEP</a>.  The protocol draft has matured and there are now implementations! (see the page).  Most notable is a <a href="/plugins/pempeth/">Wordpress plugin</a>, active on this site.

The development of that plugin also sparked an <a href="/plugins/xrds/">XRDS plugin</a>, which I have also released (despite its somewhat cryptic interface).

Those looking at <a href="/">the main page</a> may also have noticed changes. Yes, that's a mini-feed based on my online activity.  Yes, it's a plugin.  The interface, however, only allows for adding sources (not editing or removing) and is somewhat cryptic, so I have not released it yet.

You can also now log into my blog with your Facebook account (see link in header)!  This uses the API, so I don't got your Facebook password or anything like that.  Also an as-yet-unreleased plugin.

Fun days!  I'm going to be working at <a href="http://www.aiderss.com/">AideRSS </a>as a co-op in the coming months, should be fun and more freeing than school!
