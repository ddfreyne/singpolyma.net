Most everyone knows by now that Google released a major update for GMail some time ago.  This broke most Greasemonkey scripts for GMail including my <a href="<%= @items['/articles/2007110 Facebook Nofitications in GMail/index.html'].path %>">FBgmail v1</a>.  Google however, in their brilliance, released an "API" specifically for <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gmail-greasemonkey/wiki/GmailGreasemonkey10API">Greasemonkey on the new GMail</a>!  I have harnessed this to create a version of <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/14247">FBgmail for the new GMail</a>.
