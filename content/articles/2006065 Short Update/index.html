<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">So this is to be a short update on what has been happening in my life... which is just about not so muchness. We watched <i>Patch Adams</i> on Saturday -- great movie that one :D I'm staying on top in my schoolwork and my grades seem to be moving upward, which is a positive thing (no pun intended, or was it intended? I hate it when an author purposely draws attention to a might-be pun so I'm gonna shut up now ;) ) I've fixed the 'recent comments' element in my sidebar, which has been misbehaving due to some laziness on my part. Uhh... *thinks* I had something else to go in here... didn't I? maybe not :P Life runs smoothly along and all that fun stuf... we have our tickets (did I tell you that?) for June 20-something staying in Germany a few days to visit my Mom's cousin... then home before the end of June and... who knows what from there :) Really looking forward to meeting Trev and all that fun stuff :D

Some of you may have noticed (if you didn't, notice now! haha ;) ) the 'nsa blogs' element in my sidebar. If it looks like a blogring that's because it is. If you xanga people are wondering if it can be added to Xangas as well, it can. Such is the power of <a href="http://wrinks.ning.com/">Wrinks</a> -- blogrings that can be added to <i>any</i> blog and that <i>any</i> blog can be added to! One more step towards bridging the gap to our Xanga-bound neighbours ;) If you want to join the <a href="http://wrinks.ning.com/wrink.php?id=752026">NSA Blogring</a> you'll need to go to that page, sign up for an account, and then click the 'request to add site to wrink' link and enter your blog's information. I'll check the page periodically and approve new entries onto the ring.
