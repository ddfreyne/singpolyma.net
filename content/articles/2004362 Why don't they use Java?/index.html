People see Java as useful for portability, and slow because it is  interpreted, but what about its other features?

Java has more power  than any other language I've used, except C++, and C++ gives you the  wonderful ability to get yourself into trouble really easy, Java has  safeguards against all that. So why is practically everyone using  something else? You can find APIs and groups for Java, but there seems  to be so many more for other, in my opinion inferior, languages.
