I have made some updates to my <a href="<%= @items['/articles/2007111 Videntity Bookmarklet/index.html'].path %>">Videntity Bookmarklet</a>.  Besides hCards and Facebook links, it now also supports search results from <a href="http://wink.com/">wink.com</a>.  So now you can search for people and then add them directly to your friends list!
