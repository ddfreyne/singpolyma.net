No, not current events, for those are unfinished and thus unreportable.  I, of course, had some stuff to say that I promptly forgot, so take what you get I suppose ;)  School started in full force for me today -- Daniel and Dad got back on saturday -- Daniel did not, in fact, have a cavity.  He has calcium deficiency on (or off) his teeth, causing the extreme pain.  He's living on painkillers and brushing with special toothpaste for now.

We finally got to watching Pirates of the Carribean on Saturday night -- muchos kewl, much more funny! :D  Defiantely a very hilarious (and 8O most clean!) movie :)
