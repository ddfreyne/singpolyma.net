<a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/2005/11/comment-blogging.html">I posted before</a> about how some people are posting their <a href="http://dosemagazine.blogsome.com/2005/01/05/mycomments-feed-back-to-myblog/">comments to del.icio.us</a>.  At that time I said that I thought the idea good, but would far prefer it if there were a service dedicated to this use, for reasons I listed.  After some discussion on the subject, and seeing more and more how useful content is sometimes lost because it is in a comment somewhere, I decided to try my hand at implementing the idea myself.

So, using <a href="http://www.ning.com/">Ning</a> as the hosting and codebase, I have developed <a href="http://comment.ning.com/">Commentosphere</a>.  Yes, it's a tacky name, if you have another suggestion I'm more than open to it ;)  Developing on Ning was an interesting first-time experiance, on which I plan to write a post later.  Currently posting to the service is handled primarily by a bookmarklet available on the <a href="http://comment.ning.com/about.php">about page</a> or the <a href="http://comment.ning.com/addItem.php">posting page</a>, but I hope eventually to have some greasmonkey script's based off of Johan of <a href="http://ecmanaut.blogspot.com/">Ecmanaut</a>'s <a href="http://ecmanaut.blogspot.com/2005/11/comment-blogging-tool-for-blogger.html">script for del.icio.us</a>.  You must have a Ning account to add comments to the service.

For those people who have been tagged their comments on del.icio.us I have included an <a href="http://comment.ning.com/import.php">importer</a>.  Having, however, no comment data on del.icio.us myself I have not been able to properly test it, so feedback on this feature would be greatly appreciated!

Comments may be filtered by tag, user, what post they are on, what blog they are on, what parents they have (more on that below), or any combination of these.  They are also fully searchable.  Tag intersections do not work yet, but I am trying to fix that.  Syndication is possible via RSS 2.0 or JavaScript (for inclusion in a blog sidebar, see mine) and there is a <a href="http://comment.ning.com/tips.php#jsfeed">JavaScript Feed Generation</a> tool.  Other formats (including JSON) should be coming soon.

Comments are semi-threaded on Commentosphere.  It works like this: when adding a comment you can specify the permalink URLs of one or more comments that this comment is a reply to.  When viewing that comment in the app these 'parent' comments are listed and linked to.  A link to 'child' comments is presented and, if clicked, will bring up a page of all comments who have that comment set as their parent.  Multiple parents is currently a tag buggy, but that should be fixed soon.

Last but not least is the aggregator.  The aggregator lets you add posts, blogs, tags, and users to monitor for comments.  When a new comment is added to Commentosphere for any item you monitor, it will be added to your aggregator.  For off-Commentosphere comments you have the option of adding an RSS comments feed that will also have its content mixed into the page.  The page may itself be syndicated via RSS to allow you to monitor comments from blogs across the web without cluttering your reader with all the innumerable feeds.  The aggregator <span style="font-style: italic;">currently has a known bug</span> in that it does not sort the items in any way, and thus they end up chrological, but <span style="font-style: italic;">grouped by source</span>.  This is obviously not the desired behaviour and I am working to correct this.

And that, in a (large) nutshell, is it.  More information can be found on the <a href="http://comment.ning.com/about.php">about page</a> or the <a href="http://comment.ning.com/tips.php">tips page</a>.  Testing and feedback on all features (especially the del.icio.us importer) would be greatly appreciated.
