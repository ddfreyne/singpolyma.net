Let's say there is a proposal (like parts of TPP) to extend copyright and strangle the Public Domain for a time.  This sounds bad, but let's say it gets defeated.  What are we left with?  A copyright term of life + 50 years (or longer) is already strangling the progress of useful arts and culture in most of the world.

So, we lobby for a term reduction, right?  Good luck.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for a term reduction.  I'm all for many of the reforms that get proposed.  I just don't really see it happening in my lifetime.  There are treaties and lobbies and too many things preventing meaningful progress in this area.

Same goes for what should be unrelated policy areas like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_protection">copy protection</a> enforcement.  We can (and should!) decry expansions that criminalize legitimate security research and legitimate unlocking uses.  Again, however, each victory leaves us in our existing place of defeat.

We need a back door.  A way to promote art, culture, science, and innovation without climbing up the waterfall.  It begins with the understanding that the length of time a work is protected for under a copyright regime is a <em>maximum</em>.  Creators can at most any time, and for most any reason, provide the public with a license to their work under much more friendly terms than the default.

If you're familiar with the Free Culture or Free Software or other communities, this is not news.  Some creators already choose to provide the public with a license to their work.  This, however, is based entirely on creators knowing about the choices available to them, understanding the advantages, and making a decision that sometimes will benefit others more than it benefits themselves.

This is where public policy can come in.  Many governments already provide funding to various artistic or innovative ventures based on policy goals.  If a government can be convinced of the benefits of an expanded Public Domain (say) we do not have to convince them to shorten copyright terms to achieve that goal.  Much easier to implement is to use (some of) their arts funding to fund projects that will be required to (perhaps after a reasonable period of time passes, much shorter than the normal term of copyright) provide the public with a license to their work under reasonably liberal terms, and distribute without copy protection of any kind.

Instead of trying to reform the entire landscape, and instead of only hiding in our corner creating the few things we can, we carve out just a piece of policy and focus it on bettering the overall situation.  Things still get much better, and with a lot less change.
