As many of you probably know, I'm back in action!  Had taken a sabbatical while our family moved and all that wonderous stuff.  I am (mostly) checking my email / feeds regularly now and will be coming online more regularly shortly.  I'm registered for all my (college! :O) courses, so that's cool.  We have 3Mbps DSL, which is totally rocking my world :D  my nice shiny brand-new laptop is having some HD hiccups, so hopefully that'll be fixed soon.  Got a nice linux box up and running.  Met Trev... twice! :D  *watches you all go green with envy*  ;)  Had a nice time in Germany.  Rode at 110kph on the AutoBahn, hehe.  Their tram system over there is totally awesome too.  Uhh... not a whole huge bunches else to write I suppose.  Life goes on in spite of the trials and God is always faithful :)
