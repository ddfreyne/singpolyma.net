Not much is happening today... my dad is doing a lot of stuff to prepare for the container that's coming in October, which I wait for in anticipation cause it has a new computer for me in it :D

I'm also debating someone over on my <a href="http://singpolyma.blog.com/">technical blog</a> on an <a href="http://singpolyma.blog.com/83554/">old post</a>, partly about the state of the universe and partly about the existance of God.
