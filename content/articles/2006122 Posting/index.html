<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">So I'm almost done school YAY! didn't do too well on my final chem exam... hope I pass :S *sigh* but hey, let's not let that get me down! ;) nothing I can do about it anyway. In a few short weeks I should be done all my schoolwork... if I don't procrastinate through it all ;P Been doing a lot of code lately to keep myself busy. Chels has like two months left of grounding (don't remind me!) but I'm making it ok -- one day at a time ;) uhh *thinks* the pool is open again! :D they had closed it to drain+clean+repaint it, but they're done so we can go again, so that's cool. Ah, right, the 'situation' here, I should mention that. As of right now the official word is that the rebels are licking their wounds in Soudan and the election is tomorrow. Word on the street is that they've regrouped and are 'moving south' -- which means to Sahr and then here. The military in town are prepping just in case. Should be interesting, hehe. Aaaand, nothing much else happening so I'll end this post for now ;)
