Yes, you read that correctly... I just got a 29% on my chem midterm... not good...  There's questions on there we haven't studied yet, and he says in the lesson that he'll 'pad' our grade accordingly... but either way I just flunked....  Not good, since my grades are in an ever-deepening tailspin for all my courses... even my once-A+ social studies (weird for me, but hey :P) is down into the 80s and everything else is lower.  Except math, but I'm betting I start bombing it next...  *sigh*  if you guys could pray for me, I'd really appreciate it...  sometimes I want to pull out of this... and sometimes I just wish it were over... but if I flunk this year my whole future is... well... it isn't :P  Might as well shoot myself in the head if I'm just going to flunk out... no I don't quite mean that... *sigh*... I can't figure it out... school used to be a sleepthroughitandpasswithhighmarks thing... now I can't concentrate on anything and motivating myself just to get my work done is hard enough....
