<a href="http://ghill.customer.netspace.net.au/freshtags/">FreshTags' core</a> has been without update for quite some time (and, I believe, does not even render properly on the New Blogger.  <a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/2006/09/freshtags-singpolyma-2.html">My version</a> has not fared much better (although I did upgrade it to work with the new blogger :) ).  Now it is time for some improvements!

<strong>For Blogger</strong>
Full integration with the New Blogger labels system!  You have to paste a small code into your sidebar, and then FreshTags will pull its data directly from your local labels!  Great for new users or people who have fully migrated.  Best of all, to install this takes only a few steps on <a href="http://singpolymaplay.ning.com/freshtags/?install&amp;blogger">the wizard</a>.  Select 'Blogger' as the data source, enter your blog URL, change any other settings you might want, and click 'Generate Code'.  Copy the code presented into your sidebar and then click the generated button to instantly install the widget with your settings!  (Does not work on FTP blogs.)

<strong>For Everywhere</strong>
There are now three wizards for my version of FreshTags.  There is one to <a href="http://singpolymaplay.ning.com/freshtags/">generate the JSON for individual widgets</a> (hackers).  There is one to <a href="http://singpolymaplay.ning.com/freshtags/?install">generate the full code for anywhere</a> (some knowledge necessary).  Finally there is <a href="http://singpolymaplay.ning.com/freshtags/?install&amp;blogger">one that generates a one-click button</a> (or instructions and a button) for the New Blogger.

<strong>For MediaWiki</strong>
That's right.  Go over to <a href="http://www.editthis.info/bloggerhacks/">BloggerHacks</a> to see it in action.  FreshTags for MediaWiki!  The wizards (above) can generate the code, but it's a bit hackier to integrate with the sidebar.  Check out the <a href="http://www.editthis.info/bloggerhacks/MediaWiki:Sidebar">BloggerHacks Sidebar</a> and <a href="http://www.editthis.info/bloggerhacks/Header">Header Section</a> to see how I did it (click the view source wiki tab for wikicode).

<strong>For WordPress</strong>
I have updated <a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/2006/03/freshtags-for-wordpress.html">FreshTags for Wordpress</a> (with the help of my friend, <a href="http://trevorcreech.com/">Trevor Creech</a>) to work as a Wordpress Widget.  If you don't have widgets on your Wordpress blog, don't worry!  It still works the old way.<!-- technorati tags begin -->
