With  all of the efforts nowadays to bring about the 'Syndicated Web' it is  getting easier and easier to subscibe to the content you want, if only  you can find it...

The major search engines list  multiple pages from one site and rate things by hits, meaning that once  something is at the top it tends to stay there, and multiple copies of  it.  This makes finding what you want next to impossible, isn't  there some way to list each site only once or something?  And how  about having the community rate content instead of rating based on  hits?  I, for one, have often clicked a link in a search engine  that looked interesting and later wished I could takes the hits back  from the site!
