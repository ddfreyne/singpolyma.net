Yes, I've been into <a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com/">lolcats</a> and <a href="http://lolcode.com/">lolcode</a> recently.  I'm also almost done my crappy factory job (because they're laying everyone off).  This means I may be looking for a lot of freelancing stuff.  I've applied at a half-ok IT job that I may get for the next two months (I have an interview set up), but no idea.  It's a long commute too.

Ok, but let's make this relevant (because I'm also posting it on my tech blog!).  Seeing great jobs you can't get is annoying!  Like one I'm looking at right now over at Ning.  They're looking for a <a href="http://jobs.ning.com/developer-advocacy/ning-developer-advocate.html">new developer advocate</a> to replace Yoz (at least, I assume it's to replace him since he left and that was his job...).   I would LOVE that job.  Work for Ning, do what I love, get paid for it, all the best of life at once.

There are, of course, hangups.
<ol>
	<li>I do not, and do not particularly want to, live in Palo Alto, CA.  The biggest reason why not is that I'm starting school come fall and would have to move back, although family plays a part here too.</li>
	<li>I am starting school come fall.  I can't work full-time and do school full-time (at least, not in a way that would please both my employers and professors).</li>
	<li>I do not have a degree.</li>
</ol>
The last one is kind of stupid.  I know I'll learn a lot getting a degree, but my experience with Ning the last two years ought to say something.  Of course, I've never written an actually successful app.  This is mostly because I suck at PR and get my fingers in too many pots at once.  Whatever, the other two reasons are rather huge themselves.

Ok, so that's my rant-ramble-uselessness.   In case you're wondering, I am getting back to you.  Give me time.  I know I have a lot of messages from you.  I'm busy.  ;)
