I've been reading <a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/">Marc Andreessen's blog</a> for some time now, and have been ever impressed by the quality and range of content he's putting out.  One of <a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/07/eleven-lessons-.html">his recent posts</a> dealt with some meta-conversation about blogging.  Is it better to comment or to post about something on your own blog?

He makes some great point against commenting.  Comments require filtering and moderation.  Comments also seem to encourage poorly written posts or small 'me too' which are not worth reading.

He also makes a rather big point about blogging.  Anyone can do it.  There are a number of free services (Blogger and WordPress.com among them) that let ANYONE EASILY blog.

I'm not ready to turn off comments here just yet, but I must say that this makes sense to me.  If you link to me I'll find what you said.  If you trackback it still shows up here on the post.  I think there's a place for commenting, maybe, but it's definitely worth thinking about.

What do you think?  Comments, trackbacks, or both?
