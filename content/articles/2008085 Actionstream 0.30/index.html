Some significant improvements to my <a href="/ipns/singpolyma.net/plugins/actionstream/">ActionStream plugin</a>. The plugin can always be downloaded from that page.  The changes are:
<ol>
	<li>Bugfix in how some feeds were handled (notably google reader)</li>
	<li>If nicknames are being displayed, they are hcards with links to your profile at that service</li>
	<li> Including updates from your own blog is now optional</li>
	<li>There is now an option to remove services you have added</li>
	<li>Collapsed (5 more... et al) nodes may now be expanded on link click</li>
</ol>
