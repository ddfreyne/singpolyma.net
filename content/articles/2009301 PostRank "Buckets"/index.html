After an incredible amount of time working with, and for, <span class="vcard"><a class="fn url org" rel="employer" href="http://postrank.com">PostRank</a></span>, I think I have finally landed on what I would like to do with their technology that would be useful <strong>to me</strong>.

Back when I was working a lot on their Google Reader Greasemonkey overlay, one of the features requested was "sort by PostRank", which never made a lot of sense to me.  Sort <strong>what</strong> by PostRank?

Buckets.

I want to read basically everything that comes through my feedreader, or at least see the headlines, but I may not care about it all at this moment.  I don't want an interestingness sort or filter, I want a bucketizer.  I want to be able to say "I'll read the best stuff right now when I've got a few seconds, and the rest later."

I may never read the rest, which then amounts to filtering, but I may, and that's different.

The best way to implement something like this would be to allow for "filtering" by PostRank <strong>ranges</strong> instead of having a max cutoff.  That way I could have a 7+ feed, a 3-7 feed, and a 3- feed, for each feed.  I'd then make (in my reader) a "Best" folder, a "Good" folder, and a "Bottomfeeder" folder.  I'd process the content in "Best" a few times a day, "Good" at least once a week, "Bottomfeeder" whenever I had extra time to read stuff.

I actually really like this idea.  A lot.
