This plugin now lives at <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xrds-simple/">Wordpress Extend</a>.

I have updated my <a href="/ipns/singpolyma.net/plugins/xrds/">XRDS plugin</a> for Wordpress to allow for deleting XRDS services, and also to have a nice configuration UI for delegating an OpenID.Â  I have updated the tarball for both the XRDS plugin and the Pempeth plugin to include the new version.
