<b title="Updated 2007-03-26">I have re-enabled JScripts, at least for now... the URLs in the comments here for alternates also work.  We'll see what happens.  I may delete the script for my old comment form hack since it is a big bandwidth user...</b>

This is unfortunate because it affects a great many of my (and other's!) Blogger hacks.  Four of my Ning sites have been taken offline for bandwidth usage.  Some of you have written me about this.  Here is the message I got from Ning just today:
<blockquote>Hi Singpolyma,

We wanted to get in touch because several of your sites that are being
used to host scripts or to transfer blogger profiles have exceeded
projected traffic quotas for both inbound and outbound connections.

These sites are:

bloggercomments
jscripts
googlerelated
singpolymaplay

Please subscribe to the extra bandwidth premium service for these
applications to maintain their current level of service.</blockquote>
I'm surprised that so many are using googlerelated (Edit: the problem was storage space and that app is now online again), but the others are no shock.  The service needed to up each is $9.95 US per month.  I will thus be slowly moving some of these scripts (the much-used ones from singpolymaplay and the entire JScripts app) to here at singpolyma.net.  Hopefully bandwidth will not be a problem here.  The Blogger Recent Comments app is outdated, but if there are any who want it back I'm gonna need cash to re-enable it.

If any of your hacks or sites are broken, I apologise, I will try to resolve this ASAP.  Donations (see sidebar) would definately speed this process, but I'm not gonna beg for money ;)  I'll get it done in time.
