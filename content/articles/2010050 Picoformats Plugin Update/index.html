I've made some large updates to my <a href="https://singpolyma.net/2008/05/picoformats-for-wordpress/">picoformats plugin for WordPress</a> (picoformats also sometimes known as microsyntax).

<ul>
<li>Processing of comments has been removed (at least for now)</li>
<li>Both trackbacks <strong>and</strong> pingbacks are sent for @ replies</li>
<li>Trackbacks and pingbacks are sent for URLs in in-reply-to custom fields.</li>
<li>URLs are auto-linked</li>
<li>More stable regex, etc for @ reply/#hastag detection with some help from @tantek.com</li>
<li>support for starting a post's content with "reply URL", "reply #URL", "#URL", "reply post-ID", "reply #post-ID", or "#post-ID" and having in-reply-to custom field added automatically (and the reply bit at the beginning of the content snipped off).
</li></ul>
