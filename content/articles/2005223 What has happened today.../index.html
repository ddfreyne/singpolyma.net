Well, <a href="http://www.xanga.com/buhler_buhler_buhler">chels</a> finds the last post too technical for her liking and won't comment, so here's more personal ;P (no xanga smiley for that, sorry <img src="http://www.xanga.com/images/silly.gif" class="emote" />). Alright, today I spent a lot of time trying to get all the data from one of our missionary's computers to her new one. That was interesting because she wanted to transfer <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/">Thunderbird </a>mail to Outlook.  We talked her out of it, but tranferring the mail to <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x/">Mozilla Suite</a> was still a bit hard to figure.  (we couldn't just install <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a> on the new computer because we didn't have an installer and we didn't want to download it)... ok, this is getting techy again... suffice it to say, together dad and I finally got it done.

What else?  Well I <a href="http://singpolyma.blog.com/287044/">indexed my technical blog on delicious</a>, and chels dumped me... ok, that's not fair... let's be a tad more specific <img src="http://www.xanga.com/images/happy.gif" class="emote" /> :

Chels and I are not, and have not being going out... our relationship has been in a rather complicated state and today I tried to push for definition... after a lot of discussion we decided together (or at least she helped me to see) that we should back ourselves down and treat each other like what we truly are -- just friends.
