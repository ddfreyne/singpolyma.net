I'm <a href="http://twitter.com/singpolyma/statuses/777103097">updating too fast</a>.  This release brings some improvements to the UI for adding services.  There are also now options to use the plugin as a sidebar widget or with at easy-to-include post/page tag.  This release also brings the <a href="/ipns/singpolyma.net/plugins/actionstream/#comment-67638">recognition of a requirement of PHP5.2.0</a> or higher (after much debugging with <a href="http://jamesdkirk.com/">James Kirk</a>).

And, as always, bug fixes!
