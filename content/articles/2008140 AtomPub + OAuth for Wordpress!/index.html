After getting the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/oauth/browse_thread/thread/e5c73f595eac0838">answers I needed</a> from the OAuth list, I decided to go back to hacking at getting OAuth to play nice with AtomPub on my host.  I am pleased to report that it now works!  It requires a <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6995">two-line patch to Wordpress</a> (for my host anyway, YMMV), and I had to change the wp-oauth plugin a bit (<a href="http://diso.googlecode.com/svn/wordpress/wp-oauth/trunk/">lastest in SVN</a>), but I have successfully posted to my test blog using a remote AtomPub script authenticated using OAuth.

See <a href="http://singpolyma.net/oauth/example/wp_app.php.txt">some example code</a>.  The future is bright!
