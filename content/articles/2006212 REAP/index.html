Rockin'!  That's what's been going on for the past week and a half.  Let me explain...

You see, we've been in the United States thathappentobelocatedin America the last week and a bit visiting and then conferencing.  Visited Bromans (friends from Chad) in Ohio first for a few days, which was a lot of fun.  Oh, on the way down we visited Aunt Ruth (old elementary school teacher from Chad... she's not old... just we were young when she taught us...) for most of a day too.  Got totally lost on the way down (missed our turn off the highway without knowing it... the gas station people told us we were headed the right way... shows what they know :P)  By the way here, I have a habit of forgetting things.  Not that my memory is bad... I can remember facts and memorise material (if I want to) like it's nothing... but my residual-style memory is... lacking... Dan's is better, so you may want to check out <a href="http://digerbop.blogspot.com/2006/07/back-from-us.html">his post</a>.  Sometimes I tell Dan he's my secretary, because he remembers so much stuff for me.  What will I ever do without him?

Ok, on to more fun stuff.  REAP.  That stand for... a bunch of garbage.  It's a conference that is 90% mandatory for all TEAM (that's our mission) have to go to on coming home on furlough (which they now term Home Assignment).  The 90% comes from the fact that some people are good at song-and-dance excuses, and they don't have to go, hehe.  For Dad the experiance in the meetings was informative, for Mom is was somewhat boring, for me the Youth sessions were pure brilliance!

This is a milestone for me.  If you've heard what I've said about every other conference of any kind I've been to, you've heard me berate their Kids/Youth program.  I usually go to the adult sessions (for spiritual stuff) and then try to avoid the other when adults are in business.  This time there were a few of the adult workshops I wanted to go to -- but couldn't find the time becuase of the really awesome Youth program.

Lots of MKs together in one place is pretty fun by itself, and each and every one of these MKs was totally awesome.  Mornings were studies in the life of Daniel and his 'multicultural' experiance -- followed by discussion in small groups.  My group was all girls except me -- but we were all college age, so it was cool.  *cough* more than cool ;)  Lots of insight and discussion.  Then afternoons were all sorts of fun stuff -- swimming, mini-golfing, a photo scavenger hunt at the mall.  Evenings were 'tailgate parties' -- without the ballgame or beer ;)  Basically we hung out all night playing games and talking and eating :D  Lots of fun games -- some that I brought back with my to remember for later ;)

Overall it was tons of fun.  Way more than I can express here.  Now it's over and while it's good to be home, I also miss it.  Lots of new friends to keep up with by email.  One new computer-related project for one of the missionaries.  Cool stuff.  I'm sure there's tons more I could say, but for now I just want to say our God is an AWESOME God :D  I'm settiling in well, adjusting well, a week I dreaded turned out to be one of the best times I've had in ages, and Chels' Dad replied to my apology and forgave me!  No, not everything is 100% cool, but God is cool.  I feel as though I could never doubt Him again.  So much, and so amazing.  I know He's looking out for me and will continue to bless me in the days to come :)
