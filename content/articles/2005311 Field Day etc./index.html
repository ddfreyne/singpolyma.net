Saturday was <a href="http://www.teamchad.org/Palmview/">Palmview</a>'s Field Day.  I participated, as did many other non-Palmview people, but unlike many others I did terrible <img class="emote" src="http://www.xanga.com/images/silly.gif" alt=":P" /> I am definately not at my physical peak anymore... if I ever was. My best events, throwing and jumping, were total flops for me as I threw all objects at a 45Â° angle off of the legal area and ran right through the bar for high jump. My athletic abilities aside, I mostly had fun. We had a farewell potluck for a missionary that's leaving the field (probably permanently), and she's going to take a letter and the pendant I bought for <a href="http://www.xanga.com/razamoda">Chels</a> to France for me to mail them to her. She asked my parents if the'd censored it and Mom was just like 'we trust our son', hehe <img class="emote" src="http://www.xanga.com/images/winky.gif" alt=";)" />

Week 3 - Day 1 without Chels... and counting. She may not be back until that count reaches week 6... or even 8... I don't want to think about it. No chat, no email, she can't even read what I send her... but I don't send her anything just to keep the temptation away. I think I'm going to start writing and email to her that I don't send, and I'll just keep adding to it. Then when she's ungrounded I'll send the whole thing. I'd really like to ask for prayer, for both myself and Chels. I miss her a lot, and she must be missing <span style="font-style: italic;">everyone</span>.  I'd also like to ask that everyone pray we'll both be able to concentrate on our schoolwork.  I'd really appreciate it <img class="emote" src="http://www.xanga.com/images/happy.gif" alt=":)" />
