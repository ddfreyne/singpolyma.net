<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Yesterday was Valentines day, and we had a sort of party-thing hosted by Aunt Cindy McCordic for lunch. It was a lot of fun -- we ate spaghetti with cheese sauce and played some games. Two of them were mind-trick games -- one where Aunt Cindy did something we were supposed to copy, but no one could get it because they didn't notice she'd cleared her throat at the beginning, and one Janelle did called 'Chinese numbers' (but I won't tell you how it works, 'cause that'd spoil it ;) ). We also played a wonderful trick on me! You see, there's this game where you stick a funnel in the top of your pants and then stick a coin to your head and try to drop it into the funnel. Not an easy task! Well, while you're busy sticking the coin to your head, someone runs over and pours water into the funnel!! Hehe, all in all, it was great fun ;)

Not whole globs of other stuff going on right now... although I'm sure I had thought of something else to say in this post :P ah, well, I always seem to forget what all I was gonna say.

Oh, and by the way, I have a bunch of new pictures on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/singpolyma/">my flickr</a> again -- check 'em out :D</div>
