This was too good not to blog.  The social networking/ratings-and-recommendations site <a href="http://www.trustedopinion.com/">Trusted Opinion</a> is somehow prone to SPAMers!  Billed as a way for friends to rate and recommend things for each other, the service seems good on the surface.  I was never very impressed with the insides of the site, but now I'm turned off forever.

SPAM

I received today in a 'Private Message' on Trusted Opinion, SPAM.  Not just SPAM, but the kind one would expect in a poorly filtered email inbox.  It's a Nigerian money laundering scam, and real money laundering or fake, it's one of the oldest and most well known forms of SPAM.

Pretty pathetic, if you ask me.
