I have released an update to my <a href="<%= @items['/articles/2008126 Picoformats for Wordpress/index.html'].path %>">Picoformats plugin</a>.  This update changes the logic so that posts are <a href="/ipns/singpolyma.net/2008/05/picoformats-for-wordpress/#comment-76818">not modified in the database</a> (thanks, @aditya!), but on the fly.  It will also link to the <a href="http://twitter.com/als/statuses/804772950">local profile/archive of a user</a> (thanks, @als!) that has no URL set in their profile.  Also, if you use an @ reply from inside a comment and use the (one-word) name of a comment poster, it will recognize this (if they have whitespace in their name, just take it out when writing the @ reply).  @ replies in comments also do not check Twitter usernames anymore, since this is expensive and breaks common use.
