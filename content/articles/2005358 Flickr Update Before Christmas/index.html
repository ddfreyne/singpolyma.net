It is Christmas Eve and I hear people arriving for our big meal together tonight.  I've uploaded new pictures to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/singpolyma/">my Flickr</a> from just after the Christmas Program all the way through Conference pictures :) I should be updating again soon to tell you all about our Christmas :)  Have a merry one, and happy birthday to <a href="http://www.trevorcreech.com/">Trev</a>!
