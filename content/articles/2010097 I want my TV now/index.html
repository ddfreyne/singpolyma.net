I am watching <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_who">Dr. Who</a> (and some other shows) right now.  Every time I finish an episode I have to wait 7 days before I can watch another.

7 days.

Now, this 7 days is perfectly arbitrary.  It doesn't take 7 days to make an episode (it almost always takes more), nor does it take 7 days to do anything else.  The number is just a convenient amount of time for them to make you wait, such that other shows on the channel can get fair airtime.

Channel?
Airtime?

We should seriously be much past that stage by now.  The BBC has filmed at least half of the Dr. Who content for this season (they must have, in order to finish airing on time).  They may have finished all of it.

BBC, I will give you $100 to send me that content <strong>now</strong>.

If $100 doesn't seem like that much money, consider this: it is more money than they will see from me for the show otherwise.  Even if I watched ads (which I don't) or actually watched it on broadcast (which I don't), $100 is still probably more than they would get for me watching the season.  And that's just for whatever they have as prerelease content.  When more is made I'd get it again, possibly the way I do now.  It would cost the BBC a little, but I'm sure there's more than just me.

Consider: if only 200 Dr. Who viewers were interested in this, that's still $20000.

That's a lot of money to make off a group of people who would likely otherwise give you nothing.
