So, one of the things I decided to do with the <a href="/ipns/singpolyma.net/RSAkeyAnnouncement">transition to my new PGP key</a> was add a small JPEG photo (my common avatar, which is indeed a photo of me) as a UID.  This is something OpenPGP keys have supported for some time, it doesn't add too much to the keysize (as long as you keep the photo small, which I did), it helps people to identify me, and ties the key more firmly to my IRL identity.

I then discovered a problem: some old keyservers, like pgp.mit.edu, *will not* accept keys with photo UIDs.  It's not that they ignore the photo, it's that they simply refuse the key!

So, with the help of <span class="vcard tag"><a class="url fn n" href="http://fifthhorseman.net/"><span class="given-name">Daniel</span> <span class="additional-name">Kahn</span> <span class="family-name">Gillmor</span></a></span>, I have discovered the strategy for uploading these keys to the old keyservers using the CLI interface to GnuPG (which is what I normally use for my OpenPGP stuff).

<pre><kbd>cd /tmp/
mkdir -m 0700 testring
gpg --export <var>KEYID</var> | GNUPGHOME=/tmp/testring gpg --import
GNUPGHOME=/tmp/testring gpg --edit-key <var>KEYID</var></kbd></pre>
<p># Select the photo UID by typing it's number</p>
<pre><kbd>deluid
save</kbd>
<kbd>GNUPGHOME=/tmp/testring gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --send <var>KEYID</var>
rm -rf /tmp/testring</kbd></pre>
