Saving this phrasing before I forget it:

Some people are in university for accreditation, some for education.  The university tries to provide both, and as a result is suboptimal at both.  They are not complementary goals (and may even be contradictory in some cases). And, as <a title="Do one thing, do it well." href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">Unix Philosophy</a>, <a title="2. It's best to do one thing really, really well." href="http://www.google.com/corporate/tenthings.html">Google</a>, and life teaches us: doing too much means doing <abbr title="It means doing things suboptimally.">nothing well</abbr>.
