<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Yes I've been a bit sick as of late -- just haven't got around to posting about it ;) Parents think it may be malaria-related and have me on those drugs -- whatever the case it seems to be getting better :) Not a lot else happening -- school, chat, lounging around, the usual. Chels threw out her back awhile ago and that's been really bothering me... but she's recovering slowly :) How do some of you ppl post every day?? I can hardly think of anyting to write and it's been awhile... oh, I've finished up my EBC application, and their next meeting is on the 27th, so I should know if I'm in or not soon :) School seems to be going alright, and some of my marks are picking up a bit... not as good as I would have hoped, but I'll have to live with it :) Well I'm sure (as always) that there's more to say... but I can't think of a thing... so until next time and hope to see you online!
