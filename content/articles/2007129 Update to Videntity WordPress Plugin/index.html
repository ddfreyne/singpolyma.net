I have updated my <a href="http://singpolyma.net/plugins/videntity/">WordPress plugin for Videntity.org integration</a>.  It now includes options to import your friends/contacts or your profile (or both!) from Videntity to WordPress.  Just go to 'Videntity' under the 'Options' tab in your administration interface.

Some notable things not imported in the profile import:
<ul>
	<li>Instant Messeging information</li>
	<li>Video</li>
	<li>Photo</li>
	<li>Only the first URL (Website) is imported</li>
</ul>
The 'additional name' (ie, middle name) <em>is</em> imported, but into a field called 'additonal_name', which is not displayed anywhere by default on WordPress.
