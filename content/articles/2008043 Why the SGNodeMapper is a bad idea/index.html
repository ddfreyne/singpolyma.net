Don't get me wrong, I love <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/socialgraph/">Google's Social Graph API</a>, it's a great way to speed up the discovery of XFN data by using Google's cache.  What does not make sense to me, however, is their 'NodeMapper' concept that is built in to the API.  It maps multiple URLs from a site on to, not a single URL, but a SGAPI-only URI scheme.  It maps using URL patterns that are known about the site, so it doesn't even work on the web in general.  When it does work, what is it useful for?  URL consolidation.  The problem is, that the only thing you can do with a nodemapped URI is (1) use it as a unique key or (2) turn it back into a URL to get data.

I don't get it guys.  How is this better?  Is there even a reason to consolidate things like FOAF files backwards to the main page, since most people will enter the main page itself as input anyway?  Even if it was useful, shouldn't it actually map to the main page and not to some proprietary URI scheme?

Thoughts?  Anyone see a use for this that I'm missing?  Or is this misfeature just adding a layer of data that someone might use and that we'll have to hack around again later?
