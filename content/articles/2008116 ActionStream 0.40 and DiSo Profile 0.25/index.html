I have updated two of my <a href="http://diso-project.org/">DiSo</a> plugins: <a href="/plugins/diso-profile/">Profile</a> and <a href="/plugins/actionstream/">ActionStream</a>.

The profile updates mostly involve some code cleanup, a page here documenting it, and a new API to add permissions options to the permissions page.

The ActionStream update is a bit more extensive:
<ul>
	<li>Support for <a href="http://cocomment.com">coComment</a></li>
	<li>Code cleanup, of course</li>
	<li>RSS2 output option, linked from the stream output (add &amp;full for a different view)</li>
	<li>Reportedly working in WP2.5 with a patch I accepted</li>
	<li>Better Safari support</li>
	<li>If you disable showing your service usernames they are also hidden in the collapsed items</li>
	<li>Abitily to set permissions on updates from each service (if wp-diso-profile0.25 is installed)</li>
</ul>
