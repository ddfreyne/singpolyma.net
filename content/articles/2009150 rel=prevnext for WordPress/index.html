<span class="vcard tag"><a class="fn url" rel="contact friend" href="http://identi.ca/psycotica0">Christopher Vollick</a></span> pointed out to me yesterday that my site was not supporting rel=next and rel=prev.  For those who don't know, these rel attributes have been with HTML since HTML3, and they allow you to easily use a bookmarklet or extension or whatever you want to go to the next/previous page in a set of pages (like blogs archives).  This is a really great thing, and I was a bit suprised WordPress doesn't support it by default.

This can partly be implemented with a plugin, but unfortunately to fully implement it I needed to create a 3 line patch to core.  I have uploaded the tiny plugin and the patch <a href="http://gist.github.com/120586" rel="external">to a gist</a> so you can download them and install/apply to get these great features on your site!
