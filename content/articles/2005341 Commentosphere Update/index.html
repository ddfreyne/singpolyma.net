After a bit of a rocky start <a href="http://comment.ning.com/">Commentosphere</a> seems to be operating normally.  After talking a fair bit about the project and its scope with Johan of <a href="http://ecmanaut.blogspot.com/">Ecmanaut</a>, I have reduced the amount of data that needs to be input/stored for each comment and updated the labels/filters on some fields.  As a result of this there is a new bookmarklet, so you may wish to switch to that.  There are also now JSON feeds, with two callback options and a read-only XML API format for query pages.

Johan's idea of calling the service 'Webadict' has been growing on me, but the one problem there is that it would probably require changing the URL of the service, which is just about impossible on Ning if you want to keep all your data as is.

The del.icio.us importer has been taken offline, as there were performance issue with the Ning backend that caused odd (and mostly useless) results.  The Aggregator still has the same sorting problems, tag intersections are not yet supported, and the filter that finds children of the selected comment only works if the child comments have but one parent.  These are the only four currently known glitches in the system, and it seems to be working admirably besides these.

I will be out of contact for just over a week, starting this Friday.
