About time!  I've mentioned multiple times that I wanted to turn the logic I use here for user photos on comments into a plugin.  I've made two hacks for blogger that do this, after all, why not for Wordpress?

My recent work with the <a href="http://diso-project.org/">DiSo project</a> has caused this interest I had to come back, in the form of two plugins.

<strong>Plugin #1 - <a href="/plugins/avatar-from-url/">Avatar from URL</a></strong>

This plugin looks at the comment author's URL and tries to find a suitable image.  This is primarily done by looking for an <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard">hCard</a>, but it will also use other images if no hCard I found.

<strong>Plugin #2 - <a href="/plugins/allavatars/">AllAvatars</a></strong>

This plugin is what is now powering comment avatars on this blog.  It detects if you have the gravatars plugin, the avatars from URL plugin, or the favatars plugin installed and tries to use the avatar those plugins would normally give (in the listed priority order) -- thus allowing more avatars to display than with any one of these plugins.

It also detects if there is photo data in the user's profile (such as data imported by my semi-released <a href="/hcard-import-plugin.tar.gz">hCard Import plugin</a>) and overrides any other plugins with that.
