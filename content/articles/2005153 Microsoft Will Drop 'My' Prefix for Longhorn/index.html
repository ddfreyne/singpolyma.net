<blockquote><cite><a href="http://www.technewsworld.com/story/hardware/43450.html">Technology News: Hardware: Microsoft Will Drop 'My' Prefix for Longhorn</a></cite>
The "My" prefix was apparently an attempt to create a personal  connection between people and their computers at a time when the idea  of using a computer might have been forbidding.</blockquote>
Do  you realise what this means? :O  half of the Microsoft jokes won't  work anymore!  ;P  Way to prove you were wrong all along  MS.

On another note, I think that although dropping the 'my' prefix is a  good start, I do wish they would let you use custom names for things  other than the '(My) Documents' folder... I have alwasys called that  folder 'data', and I use a 'Graphics' folder and a 'Multimedia Files'  folder, and hence am constantly deleting the default '(My) Pictures'  and '(My) Music' folders Windows automatically creates... but hey, it's  a start.
