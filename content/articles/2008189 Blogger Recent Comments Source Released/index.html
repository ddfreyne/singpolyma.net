Older readers will remember my <a title="Original Announcement Post" href="/2005/12/blogger-comment-syndication-service/">Blogger Recent Comments</a> service that was hosted on <a href="http://ning.com">Ning</a>.  It has be obsolete for some time now (since Blogger now has provided their own comment feeds since v3) and has long since been shut down by Ning for being a horrible bandwidth hog.  I have thus decided to delete the app (since it's just taking up space on my Ning account) and release the code under an MIT-style license <a href="http://singpolyma.devjavu.com/browser/trunk/blogger/bloggercomments">on my devjavu repository</a>.  Maybe someone will find it useful.

Now to go see if I can use Ning for my next project... Google App Engine not having a decent cron/fakecron is not at all useful... and my Python sucks.
