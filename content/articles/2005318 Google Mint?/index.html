<a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> has launched a new service, dubbed '<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>'.  It seems to be sort of like <a href="http://www.haveamint.com/">Mint</a>, an elaborate Javascript-powered hitcounter and traffic measuring service. Unlike Mint, it is not hosted off of your webspace, but is rather managed on the Google servers. Also unlike Mint, it is free. Having never used Mint, I am not really qualified to do a comparison otherwise, but I may try out Google Analytics eventually.
