Yes, it's me, finally back and showing my face!  Ok, not literally, but whatever ;P  This may end up being long, so for those who want the short story here's and outline :
<ul><li>New computer</li><li>Sick</li><li>Conference</li><li>Misc (ie, Chels, lol)</li></ul><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Computer</span>
The last shall be first -- or whatever.  While this is a relatively new development in my life, it is an old development timewise.  It's the most important anyway! ;)  My new computer is <span style="font-style: italic;">awesome</span>!  3.4Ghz with a 185GB harddrive and 512 MB memory (eventually to become 1GB)!  For those of you to whom this is Greek take my sister's approach -- the case looks way cool!  Bubbly black and silver with blue LED light-ups :D  On top of that I got a brand-new 19-inch LCD monitor to go with it!  Biiiiig :D  Ok, enough crooning, on to real news ;)

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Sick</span>
I am sick still a bit, flu-ish, but not as bad as I was, or as others have been.  On saturday night I started shivering uncontrollably out of the blue and could barely control my muscles enough to take the two extra-strength tylonol I needed and climb into bed.  My brother was far sicker just a day before that -- throwing up and such.  My mother still has severe diherreah.  In fact, most of the TEAM Chad field is sick.  Comes from eating together for a whole week ;)

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Conference</span>
Now for the longish bit (power may go off in the middle and me losing my train of thought, but we'll see ;) ).  Day-by-day perhaps?  Let's see if my memory serves...

Day 1 (Friday) - Travelled all day to N'djamena with all the other kids (sorry, teens, nope, sorry, youths ;P).  Had a lot of fun talking and playing road games et al.  Had a good talk with Aunt Mary Stone (our driver and the only 'adult' in the car) about my past, present, and future relationship with <a href="http://www.xanga.com/razamoda">Chels</a>.  Arrived at the conference centre (just outside of NDJ, actually) dead tired and dragged my suitcase into the small, isolated room that I shared with <a href="http://digerbop.blogspot.com/">my brother</a> (no duh :P) for the week and crash.  At 7:00PM the whole field had arrived and we met in the 'caffeteria' for a... 'meal'.  I don't remember what it was, but it wasn't any good :P

Day 2 - Started with breakfast -- corn flakes!  And not stale either!  They were actually pretty good.  Talked with the new radio operator from Romania.  He doesn't speak much English, so I had to practise my French, but it was cool :)  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Power cut right here, this is the next day, sorry for the delay in the post, now back to it.</span> After breakfast we joined the worship/devotional time with the adults and then went to the (first ever) teens/youth/callussomething program.  It was pretty fun, we did a lot of stuff on identity -- especially in relation to God and the world... all though the two leaders that came out from Aussie to do the program had a lot of fun with our numerous (VERY numerous) digressions.  A lot of fun in the activities, a lot of good talk time.

Now I'm beginning to wonder why I ever started listing items by the day -- I really won't be able to do this, so I'll highlight from here on (*hears cheers*).  The study was mostly as described on all days of the conference, and was overall really nice.  I got just about zip schoolwork done though because I actually enjoyed the program this time so I didn't sneak off to do my work like last year ;P  I got my hands on a good parenting book (for parenting teens) while up there and devoured the whole thing during siestas.  Very good book.

There were two 'Sports &amp; Leisure' afternoons during the whole conference -- which were mostly sports or watching.  I played volleyball the first time and it was really a lot of fun.  The net was tied between two trees and the serves from the other team kept getting caught in the branches and then falling out of bounds ("Tree-fense!")  The second afternoon everyone was sick and tired (literally! ;) )  so we mostly lounged around.

Then there was the brilliant Megan evening.  We (the teen gang + leaders) were outside in the evening, preparing for our first and only evening 'session', when Aunt Anne Hoyt (Janelle's Mom) came out and asked us to look after little Megan Godbold for the evening so that the little kids' team could have a break.  We agreed -- mistake #1.  Don't get me wrong, I like little kids.  Ask someone who knows me well and they'll tell you that I positively <span style="font-style: italic;">adore</span> little kids -- sometimes even after they can talk.  Megan is like 5, and at that age where you can give her ideas, but then they're hers.  The night was too bright to play the game we were going to play, and we couldn't have a serious spiritual discussion with Megan around ("No, my daddy says..." *cough*).  So we decided to play "Follow Megan".  Part way into our following Tim (one of the leaders) decided it would be funny to pretend a tree was eating him.  For the rest of the night Megan led us around, identifying 'bad trees' and having Tim speak with them to command that they leave little children alone.  You can imagine how the whole thing turned out! :P

Ok, then came fun night.  Fun night (which is best described as a skit night where there are some non-skit performances) was the funnest in quite awhile!  Recently we've had a lot more serious stuff (music performaces and the like).  This year we had multiple side-splitting performances, including a repeat from 7 years ago when I first came to the field!  MAF's was, as always, the funniest.  They did a MAF-on-MAF thing, exaggerating some of the problems they've been having etc.  The skit was 'hosted' by Uncle Patrik, who used to be a professional circus performer before he became a pilot.  The whole act was hilarious with numerous balloon tricks and some other stuff in just to make it funnier as we went!

The day after conference we (my family) went to the TEAM station in NDJ and I lounged for the day, reading.  My parents went shopping and we all went out for lunch (normally something I hate, but this place had GOOD cheeseburgers :D).  Then the next day my siblings and I jumped in the back of the pickup (travel plan changes) and we drove all day to get back down.  No more to tell, here we are :)

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Misc</span></span>
What post of mine would be complete without <span style="font-style: italic;">some</span> mention of Chels?  There already has been minorly, but just a footnote here.  She's still grounded and (hopefully) more comitted to obeying the rules of that grounding.  For those who haven't heard (which is no one) she and I are not anymore.  Not even close.  She's been on to better and more and is now single.  I had more to say (not about her) but it's lunch time and this is long enough for now.  So long, and thanks if yu actually read all of this!
