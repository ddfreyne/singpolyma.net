Awhile ago I received this message from an unidentified user:
<blockquote>Title: photo for authors
Can you use javascript to show an author's photo in the footer of a post? I've looked everywhere and only find it in the old blogger Any help would be awesome!</blockquote>
While a script based on my <a href="http://singpolyma.net/2007/05/new-comment-photo-hack-blogger/">new comment author photos</a> could be built to inject the image for the post author (multi-author blogs), I thought it might first be useful to provide basic information about hard-coding this.
<ol>
	<li>Go to the Template tab on your blog's dashboard</li>
	<li>Select Edit HTML</li>
	<li>Check the Expand Widget Templates box</li>
	<li>Find the code block starting with <code>&lt;div class='post-footer'&gt; or after &lt;data:post.body/&gt;</code></li>
	<li>Insert the content you want there</li>
	<li>Save!</li>
</ol>
