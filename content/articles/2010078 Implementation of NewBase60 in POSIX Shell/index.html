I have written an implementation of @tantek.com's <a rel="reference" href="http://tantek.pbworks.com/NewBase60">NewBase60</a> in POSIX-compliant shell script for use in all your shell-based programming.

It is up <a rel="enclosure" href="http://gist.github.com/338295">as a gist</a>.  Unfortunately it is CC-BY-SA because that is what the original code is.  I will release it ISC if @tantek.com is okay with it.
