Hash: SHA1,SHA256

I am in the process of moving my PGP key over from my old 1024 DSA key
to my new 4096 RSA key.  The primary reason for this change is to help
facilitate moving away from the deprecated SHA1 digest mechanism as
discussed at <http://www.debian-administration.org/users/dkg/weblog/48>.

I have signed my new key with my old key, and set it up as my default for
signing and encryption.  I have posted the fingerprint for my new key on my
website at <http://singpolyma.net>.  My old key will still work for some
time, but I will eventually issue a revocation for it and use it only for
decrypting my mail archive from before the switchover.

This message is signed with both the old key and the new key.  Please verify
the signatures so that you can trust my new key.  I have placed the key
information for both keys below for verification purposes.

Hopefully my choice of a rather large RSA key will keep me somewhat future
proof for quite awhile.
